# Character attributes

**Where to change them:** in Studio, select `StarterPlayer > StarterCharacter` and scroll the Properties panel
to **Attributes** (values there apply to every new spawn). While playing, select your character model under
`Workspace` (your player name) to change them live for that session only.

All tuning lives in attributes on the character model (`StarterPlayer.StarterCharacter`), so values can be
changed in Studio's Properties panel without touching code. Defaults below are the current values.

## Movement (test values — SRD speeds not decided yet)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| MoveWalkSpeed | 20 | Walk speed (studs/s) (was 16) |
| MoveRunSpeed | 44 | Run speed while Shift is held (was 34, before that 28) |
| MoveRoarSpeed | 4 | Speed while roaring |
| MoveCreepSpeed | 10 | Speed while C is held (creep) |

Speed priority (SprintTest 1.2): roar > run > creep > walk. SprintTest 1.4: roar > exhausted (creep speed) > run > creep > walk.

## Stamina (StaminaServer 1.1 / StaminaBar 1.0)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| StaminaEnabled | true | false = always full, never exhausted |
| StaminaMax | 100 | Full bar |
| StaminaRunTime | 15 | Seconds of running from full to empty |
| StaminaRefillTime | 5 | Seconds to refill from empty |
| StaminaBiteCost | 10 | Stamina per accepted bite (bites are never blocked; clamped at 0) |
| StaminaRegenDelay | 0.75 | Seconds after the last run, bite or leap before refilling starts |
| StaminaRecoverFraction | 0.25 | Exhausted until the bar refills to this share (25%) |
| StaminaTiredBiteMul | 0.6 | Damage × for a bite started while exhausted (BiteServer 1.4, every target incl. the dummy): torso 15, head 23, tail 8 |

Drains only while the dino really runs (run key held, not exhausted, horizontal speed above halfway between walk and run speed).
At 0: `Exhausted` = true → creep crouch (CreepServer 1.1) at MoveCreepSpeed, no running (SprintTest 1.4), red pulsing bar.
Curve (replicated): `StaminaValue`, `StaminaRate` (per s), `StaminaAt` (server time); stamina = clamp(Value + Rate × (now − At), 0, Max).
Diagnostics: server `StaminaState` (full/running/delay/refilling/exhausted/disabled), `StaminaLastEvent`, `StaminaRunWanted`,
`StaminaBiteCount`, `StaminaJumpCount` (1.1), `StaminaExhaustCount`, `Exhausted`, `CreepWanted`; client `StaminaBarState` (waiting/normal/low/exhausted), `StaminaShown`.

Pounce-only stamina (StaminaServer 1.4 / StaminaBar 1.1; TRexModelData 1.22 / RaptorModelData 1.12): `StaminaPounceOnly` = true →
no run drain, never `Exhausted`; costs `StaminaBiteCost` 0, `JumpStaminaCost` 0, `RamStaminaCost` 0; `PounceStaminaCost` 15 and
`PounceLatchDrain` 15/s unchanged (a latch / pin starts at 85 and releases at 0 after about 5.7 s); refill hidden at the normal rate.
The bar shows only while `PounceLatched` (latch or pin); client `StaminaBarState` adds "ground" (hidden on the ground) and
"disabled" (StaminaEnabled false). Verified in Play: pin → bar 85 → 0 in 5.69 s, release "stamina", bar hidden after; three T-Rex
bites left stamina at 100.

## Kill regen (KillRegenServer 1.0 / BiteServer 1.6 / PounceServer 1.3)
| Attribute (character) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| KillRegenEnabled | true | Heal after a kill |
| KillRegenFraction | 0.25 | Share of MaxHealth given back per kill (T-Rex 50, raptor 15) |
| KillRegenTime | 5 | Seconds the heal is spread over (evenly, capped at MaxHealth; each kill stacks its own stream) |

Kill = the killing blow on a bot (`IsBot`): the bite or pounce hit that takes `DummyHealth` from above 0 to 0 stamps the bot with
`KilledBy` (player name), `KilledByUserId`, `KilledWith` ("bite" / "pounce") and, last, `KilledAt`; the bot gets
`KillRegenCredited` (player name / "noPlayer" / "dead" / "disabled").
Diagnostics: character `KillCount`, `LastKillTarget`, `LastKillWith`, `KillRegenActive`, `KillRegenRemaining`, `KillRegenLastAmount`,
`KillRegenLastAt`, `KillRegenHealed` (+ `KillRegenHealedExact`); player `DinoKills`; script `KillRegenServerVersion`, `KillRegenKills`.
Verified in Play: T-Rex bite kill 100 → 150; raptor pin kill 30 → 45 in a straight line over 5.00 s.

## Hunger and thirst (SurvivalServer 1.0 / SurvivalBars 1.0)
Modelled on The Isle (Evrima): two meters that drain over time; an empty meter damages health until the dino eats /
drinks or dies. No link to stamina; no passive regen (KillRegenServer 1.0 unchanged).

| Attribute (character) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SurvivalEnabled | true | Meters run; false = frozen, HUD hidden, E not taken |
| HungerMax / ThirstMax | 100 / 100 | Meter size (both species) |
| HungerDrainTime / ThirstDrainTime | 480 / 360 | Seconds from full to empty at drain mul 1 (Arcade pace) |
| SurvivalDrainMul | by Species | TRex 1, Raptor 1.25 (raptor: 384 s / 288 s); set to override |
| StarveDamageRate / DehydrateDamageRate | 0.01 / 0.01 | Share of MaxHealth lost per second while that meter is 0 (both empty = both) |
| EatRate / DrinkRate | 10 / 15 | Meter points per second while holding E |
| EatRange | 8 | Flat (X/Z) studs from the head to the carcass box |
| EatHeight | 20 | Head at most this far above the carcass box top / below its bottom |
| SurvivalWarnFraction | 0.2 | Below this share of max: warning (red pulsing bar) |

| Attribute (SurvivalServer script) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SurvivalCarcassEnabled | true | KO'd / killed bots leave a carcass |
| SurvivalCarcassTime | 90 | Seconds a carcass stays (or until eaten) |

State (character, server): `Hunger`, `Thirst` (exact), `HungerState` / `ThirstState` (ok / warning / empty), `SurvivalState`
(ok / warning / starving / dehydrating / starvingAndDehydrating / dead / disabled), `SurvivalCanEat`, `SurvivalNearCarcass`,
`SurvivalCanDrink`, `SurvivalWaterSource` (lake / sea / none), `SurvivalAction` (none / eating / drinking).
Diagnostics (character, server): `SurvivalVersion`, `SurvivalLastChange` + `SurvivalLastChangeAt` (meter state from → to and the
value that triggered it), `SurvivalActionResult` (started / released / full / outOfRange / notInLake / dead / disabled / switched /
badArg), `SurvivalActionStartedAt` / `SurvivalActionStoppedAt`, `LastAteAt`, `LastDrankAt`, `SurvivalFoodEaten`, `SurvivalWaterDrunk`,
`StarveDamageTaken` / `DehydrateDamageTaken` (exact), `SurvivalDamageTaken` (whole), `SurvivalDiedOf`.
Diagnostics (character, client): `SurvivalBarsVersion`, `SurvivalBarsState` (normal / warning / empty / disabled), `SurvivalHint`,
`SurvivalInputBound`, `SurvivalHolding`.
Carcass (Workspace.DinoCarcasses.Carcass_<Species>_<n>): `Carcass`, `CarcassSpecies`, `CarcassFood`, `CarcassFoodMax`, `CarcassFrom`,
`CarcassKilledBy`, `CarcassCreatedAt`, `CarcassExpiresAt`. Script: `SurvivalServerVersion`, `SurvivalCarcasses`, `SurvivalCarcassesMade`,
`SurvivalCarcassesEaten`, `SurvivalCarcassesExpired`, `SurvivalCarcassLastRemoved`, `SurvivalCarcassLastSkipped`.
Verified in Play (T-Rex): drain 0.208 / 0.278 per s; lake drink 40 → full ("full"); sea shallows = "sea", no drink, E not bound;
raptor carcass 60 food eaten at 10/s, carcass removed ("eaten"), action stopped "outOfRange"; Hunger 0 → 2 HP/s (1% of 200);
Ram not triggered while E ate / drank.

## Camera (CameraZoom)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CameraStartZoom | 35 | Camera distance (studs) set on every spawn; scroll / pinch still zooms |

## Shoulder camera (ShoulderCam 1.0 / TurnLimit 1.1 aim mode)
Fixed over-the-shoulder camera on the owner's client (Scriptable camera, cursor locked to the centre, small white
centre dot). Mouse / right stick / touch drag (right 60% of the screen) aims; the body turns toward the camera yaw at
`TurnLimitRate` (TurnLimit 1.1 `TurnLimitMode` = "aim", set by ShoulderCam): W/S move along the aim, A/D strafe.
Q / gamepad R3 / touch **Shoulder** swaps shoulders (starts right = dino on the left of the screen). Hold Left Alt (or
open the Roblox menu) for a free cursor. Scroll / pinch zooms 0.6–1.5× of the distance. The camera is pulled in to just
before world geometry (dinos, hitboxes and this dino ignored); Humanoid.CameraOffset (bite punch, roar shake) still applies.
Framing defaults are measured from the model at spawn; any attribute below overrides.

| Attribute | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ShoulderCamEnabled | true | false = Roblox's camera (Custom), mouse free, TurnLimitMode "move" |
| ShoulderCamDistance | CameraStartZoom (T-Rex 35, raptor 16) | Camera distance behind the focus (studs, × zoom) |
| ShoulderCamFocusHeight | 0.75 × model top above the HRP (T-Rex 8.1, raptor 1.7) | Focus point above the HumanoidRootPart |
| ShoulderCamSide | max(0.6 × width, 0.9 × top + 1) (T-Rex 10.7, raptor 3) | Sideways offset toward the shoulder |
| ShoulderCamHeight | 0.35 × top (T-Rex 3.8) | Extra camera height |
| ShoulderCamSensitivity | 0.25 | Degrees per mouse pixel |
| ShoulderCamPadSpeed | 240 | Right-stick turn speed (°/s at full tilt; 0.15 deadzone) |
| ShoulderCamTouchSensitivity | 0.35 | Degrees per touch-drag pixel |
| ShoulderCamPitchMin / Max / Start | −55 / 65 / −12 | Pitch limits and start (°) |
| ShoulderCamZoomMin / Max | 0.6 / 1.5 | Zoom range (wheel step 0.1) |
| ShoulderCamSwapTime | 0.2 | Seconds the shoulder swap slides |
| TurnLimitMode | "move" (ShoulderCam sets "aim") | TurnLimit 1.1: "aim" = body turns to the camera yaw, camera-relative movement |

Test hook: `ShoulderCamLookAt` (Vector3) turns the camera to look at that point once, then is cleared.
Diagnostics, owner client: `ShoulderCamState` (aim/free/off), `ShoulderSide` (right/left), `ShoulderCamYaw`,
`ShoulderCamPitch`, `ShoulderCamZoom`, `ShoulderCamBlocked`, `ShoulderCamNowDistance`, `ShoulderCamNowFocusHeight`,
`ShoulderCamNowSide`, `ShoulderCamNowHeight`; TurnLimit 1.1 `TurnLimitState` adds aiming/aimAligned.

## Idle (IdlePose)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| IdleEnabled | true | Animation on/off |
| IdlePeriod | 1.0 | Seconds per breathing loop |
| IdleBob | 0.3 | Body dip (studs) |
| IdleHead | 1.0 | Head/jaw motion multiplier |

| IdleTailPeriod | 2.0 | Seconds per idle tail sway loop (was tied to the 1 s breath) |
| IdleLookEnabled | true | Occasional head turn |
| IdleLookAngle | 30 | Head turn (degrees) |
| IdleLookMinGap / MaxGap | 3 / 7 | Random wait between turns (s) |
| IdleLookHold | 1.2 | Time held to the side (s) |

## Walk / Run (WalkPose) — every Walk* has a Run* twin; speed blends between them
| Walk | Run | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| WalkStepLength 6 | RunStepLength 6.5 (default) | Distance a planted foot travels per step |
| WalkDuty 0.6 | **RunDuty 0.48** | Share of the cycle each foot is planted (higher = heavier) |
| WalkLift 1.6 | RunLift 2.4 | Foot lift (studs) |
| WalkCrouch 0.5 | RunCrouch 1.0 | Knee bend / body lowered |
| WalkFootForward 1.2 | RunFootForward 1.6 | Foot path shifted forward |
| WalkToeDrop 25 | RunToeDrop 35 | Toes pointing down mid-swing (°) |
| WalkSway 1.0 | RunSway 0.6 | Body side roll/yaw |
| WalkBounce 0.35 | **RunBounce 0.3** | Body spring |
| WalkBodyRock 4 | RunBodyRock 6 | Forward/back pitch per step (°) |
| WalkHeadBob 6 | RunHeadBob 8 | Neck/head nod (°) |
| WalkTailWhip 1.0 | RunTailWhip 0.7 | Tail swing + whip |
| WalkArmSwing 25 | RunArmSwing 10 | Arm swing (°) |
| — | **RunLean 11** | Forward lean while running (°) |
| — | RunArmTuck 35 | Arms folded while running (°) |
| WalkTailRate 0.5 | — | Tail swing speed while moving, as a share of the step rate (all gaits) |

Bold = "heavier, more powerful T-Rex" preset (set on the character). `WalkLegSwing` is unused since WalkPose v2.0.

## Creep (WalkPose 3.1 / CreepTest / CreepServer) — every gait value above also has a Creep* twin
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| CreepEnabled | true | Creep allowed (server-checked) |
| CreepStepLength | 5.5 | Step length while creeping |
| CreepDuty | 0.7 | Feet planted most of the cycle (careful steps) |
| CreepLift | 1.3 | Foot lift |
| CreepCrouch | 2.2 | Body lowered (studs) |
| CreepFootForward | 1.4 | Foot path shifted forward |
| CreepToeDrop | 15 | Toes down mid-swing (°) |
| CreepSway | 0.3 | Body side roll/yaw |
| CreepBounce | 0.05 | Body spring |
| CreepBodyRock | 1.5 | Forward/back pitch per step (°) |
| CreepHeadBob | 1.5 | Neck/head nod (°) |
| CreepTailWhip | 0.35 | Tail swing + whip |

## Roar (RoarPose / RoarFX / RoarServer)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| RoarEnabled | true | Roar allowed |
| RoarDuration | 1.4 | Whole roar (s) |
| RoarCooldown | 3 | Seconds between roars (server-checked) |
| RoarRadius | 30 | How far the sound waves travel (studs) |
| RoarWaveSize | 18 | Wave diameter at full reach (studs) |
| RoarJawOpen | 40 | Jaw opening (°) |
| RoarShake | 2.5 | Head shake (°) |
| RoarShakeCamera | 0.35 | Camera shake for players inside the radius |
| RoarSoundId | rbxassetid://105842146042073 | Roar audio (TRex_Roar_v1.0.mp3) |
| RoarDebuffEnabled | true | Roar debuff on (RoarServer 1.1) |
| RoarConeAngle | 90 | Roar hit cone in front of the mouth (°; 45 each side); range = RoarRadius |
| RoarDebuffDuration | 8 | Seconds the debuff lasts; a new roar hit refreshes it (no stacking) |
| RoarDebuffDamageTaken | 1.25 | Damage taken while debuffed (×; +25%) |
| RoarDebuffSpeed | 1.1 | Move speed while debuffed (×; +10%; players via SprintTest, the display T-Rex via WalkTest 1.3) |

Roar debuff: a dino (Species attribute; not the roarer, not the dummy) is hit when it is within RoarRadius of the mouth front,
inside the cone, and a ring is passing it (rings stream out from 20% to 80% of the roar and fly 30 studs in 0.75 s).
Target state (replicated): `DebuffUntil` (server time), `DebuffDamageTakenMul`, `DebuffSpeedMul`, `DebuffBy`, `DebuffSource` (roar),
`DebuffCount`, `DebuffState` (roared/none). Roarer diagnostics: `RoarEffectState` (sweeping/done/disabled), `RoarHits`, `RoarHitNames`.
Speed: SprintTest 1.3 multiplies the chosen speed by `DebuffSpeedMul` while debuffed (`MoveSpeedMul` diagnostic). The display T-Rex
(WalkTest 1.3) runs its walk clock at `DebuffSpeedMul` (`WalkTestClockRate` diagnostic), so its walk, turns and pauses run 10% faster.
Badges (StatusBadges 1.0, every client): above the dino while `DebuffUntil` is in the future — blue `▼ DEF` when `DebuffDamageTakenMul` > 1,
red `▲ SPD` when `DebuffSpeedMul` > 1 (players and NPCs, StatusBadges 1.1); a timer bar empties over the effect and the badge pops on apply/refresh.
Diagnostics (client): `StatusBadgesState` (none/def/spd/def,spd), `StatusBadgesVersion`.

## Bite (BitePose / BiteTest / BiteServer / BiteFX)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BiteEnabled | true | Bite allowed (client + server checked) |
| BiteWindup | 0.15 | Seconds: neck rears up, jaw gapes |
| BiteStrike | 0.10 | Seconds: neck drives forward/down, jaws shut (contact at the end) |
| BiteRecover | 0.30 | Seconds back to the base pose (head thrash on a hit) |
| BiteJawOpen | 45 | Jaw gape (°) |
| BiteRear | 14 | Neck rear-up in the wind-up (°) |
| BiteLunge | 20 | Neck drive-down at the strike (°) |
| BiteReach | 1.2 | Neck slides forward at the strike (studs) |
| BiteShake | 14 | Head thrash after a hit (°) |
| BiteShakeTime | 0.30 | Thrash length (s) |
| BiteHitStop | 0.06 | Pose freeze on a hit (s) |
| BiteCooldown | 0.8 | Seconds between bites (server-checked) |
| BiteDamage | 25 | Damage per bite (dummies only for now) |
| BiteRange | 5 | Hit capsule radius (studs); the capsule line runs from BiteReachBack behind the mouth front to BiteRange/2 ahead |
| BiteReachBack | 8 | Studs the hit capsule reaches back along the snout (targets the head has pushed into still count) |
| BiteLungeDist | 3 | Forward push during the strike (studs) |
| BiteSoundId | rbxassetid://108790087307118 | Chomp sound (Creator Store placeholder) |

### Raptor bite (RaptorModelData 1.11 / raptor_generator 1.11)
The player raptor's bite = the raptor bot's bite (BotServer SPECIES Raptor: 8 dmg / 1 s / reach 3). Same BiteTest 1.4 /
BiteServer 1.5 path as the T-Rex; only these values differ (everything else inherited from TRexModelData).

| Attribute | Raptor value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BiteEnabled | true | Bite on (was false since RaptorModelData 1.0) |
| BiteDamage | 8 | Base damage (× hit zone: head 12, torso 8, tail 4) |
| BiteCooldown | 1 | Seconds between bites |
| BiteRange | 3 | Capsule radius = the bot's reach |
| BiteReachBack | 0 | Capsule runs from the mouth front to 1.5 studs ahead: a 3-stud ball around the snout |

Reach (rest pose, HRP space): mouth front 5.2 ahead → capsule tip 6.7 → hit surface up to ~9.7 ahead, plus the 3-stud
BiteLungeDist. Verified in Play (RaptorModelData 1.11): raptor bot torso 60 → 52, tail 52 → 48 (×0.5), arm 48 → 40;
cooldown blocks a second click 0.4 s later; bot 19 studs ahead (nearest hitbox ≥ 16) = miss; T-Rex bot leg (LegL) 200 → 192.

## Hit zones (BiteServer 1.3) — read from the bitten dino
| Attribute | Value | Zone (hitbox segments) |
|---|---|---|
| HitZoneHeadMul | 1.5 | head: Head, Jaw, Neck (25 → 38) |
| HitZoneTorsoMul | 1 | torso: Torso, legs, shins, feet, arms (25) |
| HitZoneTailMul | 0.5 | tail: Tail1–5 (25 → 13) |

Damage = round(BiteDamage × zone × debuff). Zone = the target hitbox nearest the bite tip (server check) or nearest the claimed point
(client claim). The training dummy has no zones and no debuff (always BiteDamage). Debuffed: torso 31, head 47, tail 16.
Diagnostics (attacker): `BiteHitZone` (head/torso/tail/dummy), `BiteHitSegment`, `BiteHitZoneMul`, `BiteHitDebuffMul`, `BiteHitBaseDamage`;
`BiteHitDamage` = final damage. BiteServer 1.4 adds `BiteHitTiredMul` (1, or 0.6 for an exhausted bite).

Bite diagnostics: client `BiteState` (none/windup/strike/recover, `-hit`), `BiteSource` (server/predicted),
`BiteInputResult`, `BiteLungeMoved`, `BiteClaim` (sent/none), `BiteFXHits`, `BiteSoundLoaded`, `BitePredictedAt`; server `BiteStartedAt`,
`BiteCount`, `BiteLastResult` (ok/cooldown/roaring/disabled/dead/badArg), `BiteLastContact` (hit/miss), `BiteStartLag`,
`BiteHitSource` (client/server), `BiteClaimResult` (ok/noBite/stale/resolved/late/badTarget/offTarget/far/badArg), `BiteClaimDist`,
`BiteHitAt`, `BiteHitPos`, `BiteHitDamage`, `BiteHitTarget`, `BiteHitCount`. Dummy: `DummyHealth`, `DummyMaxHealth`,
`DummyState` (ready/ko), `DummyKOs`.

## Species (SpeciesServer 1.0 / SpeciesPicker 1.0) and the Raptor
The raptor's own values live in `RaptorModelData` (see `docs/STYLE_Raptor.md`): walk 30, run 52, TurnLimitRate 540,
CameraStartZoom 16, roar / bite / creep off, its gait values and RunNeckDrop 20.
Since RaptorModelData 1.11 the bite is on (see "Raptor bite" under Bite).
WalkPose 3.3 settings (defaults keep the T-Rex unchanged):

| Attribute | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| WalkStrideStretch / RunStrideStretch / CreepStrideStretch | 1 | × ground covered per gait cycle: > 1 = fewer steps, planted feet glide by (1 − 1/stretch) of the speed |
| RunNeckDrop | 0 | Degrees the neck lowers at full run (head dips when sprinting) |

Diagnostics: player `DinoSpecies`, `SpeciesLastResult` (ok/same/badArg/cooldown/noTemplate); SpeciesServer script attribute
`SpeciesTemplate` (ready/missing); client `SpeciesPickerState`, `SpeciesPickerLast`.

## Leap (JumpTest 1.0 / JumpServer 1.0 / JumpPose 1.0 / StaminaServer 1.1)
Only dinos with `JumpEnabled = true` (the Raptor) use it; the T-Rex keeps the default Roblox jump.
Press jump → 0.12 s crouch → launch 11 studs high (JumpPower 59, measured 11.0 studs and 0.67 s in the air; the Humanoid's
floor push adds speed during liftoff, so the height is above JumpPower² / 2g).
If moving faster than 2 studs/s at takeoff, +10 studs/s along the body's forward. While move input is held in the
air, the boosted speed is kept (a client-side LinearVelocity constraint in Plane mode holds the horizontal velocity;
Humanoid.WalkSpeed is not touched) and the leap steers at the body's turn rate; no input = Roblox air control.
Measured (raptor, open ground): standing leap 11.0 studs / 0.67 s; running leap takeoff 52 → 62 held to landing,
41.1 studs long; W+A mid-air turns the path 45°; releasing input slows 62 → 3 in 0.35 s; held key = 7 leaps from full
stamina, then "stamina".
Holding the key re-leaps on landing. Each accepted leap costs 15 stamina; no leap while exhausted or below 15.

| Attribute | Raptor value (default) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| JumpEnabled | true (false) | Leap instead of the default jump |
| JumpWindup | 0.12 | Crouch seconds before the launch |
| JumpLaunchPower | 59 | Humanoid.JumpPower at the launch (59 → 11.0 studs measured) |
| JumpBoost | 10 | Forward studs/s added at takeoff |
| JumpBoostMinSpeed | 2 | Horizontal studs/s needed at takeoff for the boost |
| JumpAirHold | true | Keep the leap speed in the air while input is held (steerable) |
| JumpStaminaCost | 15 | Stamina per accepted leap; also the minimum needed to leap |
| JumpCooldown | 0.5 | Seconds between accepted leaps (server and client) |

JumpPose 1.0 shape values (defaults; studs × geo.scale, foot targets as shares of leg reach): `JumpPoseEnabled` true;
crouch `JumpCrouch` 3, `JumpCrouchLean` 12, `JumpCrouchNeck` 18, `JumpCrouchTail` 10, `JumpCrouchArms` 25; push
`JumpPushBack` 22, `JumpPushExtend` 0.97, `JumpPushToe` 45, `JumpLaunchPitch` 14, `JumpPushTime` 0.15; tuck
`JumpTuckFwd` 0.14, `JumpTuckDown` 0.5, `JumpTuckToe` 30, `JumpAirTail` 10, `JumpAirArms` 35, `JumpAirPitch` 10,
`JumpAirNeck` 10; reach `JumpReachFwd` 0.24, `JumpReachDown` 0.84, `JumpReachToe` −10; land `JumpLandTime` 0.22,
`JumpLandCrouch` 2.5, `JumpLandLean` 8, `JumpLandNeck` 12, `JumpLandTail` 8.

Diagnostics: owner client `JumpTestState` (disabled/ready/crouch/air/dead), `JumpInputResult`
(sent/air/exhausted/stamina/cooldown/dead/denied/noLiftoff), `JumpInputSource` (inputAction/humanoid), `JumpPredictedAt`,
`JumpLaunchCount`, `JumpTakeoffSpeed`, `JumpBoostApplied`, `JumpLeapSpeed`, `JumpAirSpeed`, `JumpPeakHeight`, `JumpAirTime`,
`JumpAirHoldState` (off/holding/released), `JumpAirDistance`.
Server (replicated): `JumpStartedAt`, `JumpServerResult` (ok/badArg/dead/disabled/exhausted/stamina/cooldown), `JumpCount`,
`JumpDenyCount`, `JumpDeniedAt`, `JumpDenyReason`. Every client (jump-enabled dinos): `JumpState`
(none/crouch/push/rise/fall/land), `JumpBlend`, `JumpSource` (server/predicted), `JumpGroundDist`.

## Pounce (PounceTest 1.0 / PounceServer 1.0 / PouncePose 1.0 / StaminaServer 1.2)
Only dinos with `PounceEnabled = true` (the Raptor). F / gamepad X / touch Pounce button → 0.1 s crouch → flat lunge
(20 studs, 70 studs/s, ~0.3 s, 2.7 studs high). Touching a hitbox of a larger dino (Bitable + Species, extents ≥ 1.5× the
raptor's: the display T-Rex now; player T-Rex once PvP damage exists) latches on: the raptor clings to that body part,
riding its animation, and bites. Damage 8 on landing + 4 every 0.5 s (× roar debuff, no hit zones). Stamina −15 for the
pounce, −15/s while latched. Lets go on jump (leaps off), stamina 0, target KO. Miss = lands ~22 studs ahead.

| Attribute | Raptor value (default) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| PounceEnabled | true (false) | Has the pounce (and the Pounce button) |
| PounceWindup | 0.1 | Crouch seconds before the lunge |
| PounceDistance | 20 | Studs the lunge covers on flat ground |
| PounceUpSpeed | 28 | Upward studs/s at the launch (sets the arc; JumpPower is set to this for the launch) |
| PounceReach | 1.6 | Radius of the contact sweep at the snout |
| PounceCooldown | 3 | Seconds between pounces (client + server) |
| PounceStaminaCost | 15 | Stamina per pounce; also the minimum needed |
| PounceLatchDrain | 15 | Stamina per second while latched |
| PounceLandDamage | 8 | Damage when it latches |
| PounceTickDamage / PounceTickInterval | 4 / 0.5 | Damage per bite / seconds between bites while latched |
| PounceSizeRatio | 1.5 | Target must be at least this many times the raptor's size |
| PounceClaimWindow | 0.9 | Seconds after the start a latch claim is accepted |
| PounceLatchStandoff | 2.4 | Studs the body sits off the gripped surface |
| PounceLeapOffSpeed / PounceLeapOffUp | 30 / 35 | Studs/s away from the surface / up when jumping off |

PouncePose 1.0 shape values (defaults): `PouncePoseEnabled` true; lunge `PounceLungePitch` 18, `PounceLungeLegFwd` 0.55,

### Pin (PounceTest 1.1–1.2 / PounceServer 1.1 / WalkTest 1.5)
A pounce on a Bitable + Species dino smaller than `PounceSizeRatio` × the raptor's size (same size or smaller: the
display raptor now; player dinos once PvP damage exists) pins it: the target is knocked onto its side (WalkTest 1.5
"pinned"), the raptor stands on top of it (upright, facing the lunge direction, at the target's HumanoidRootPart X/Z and
`PouncePinRideHeight` above the ground under it — default own hip height + 0.9 × the target's thickness) and bites with
the latch pose. Damage and stamina are the same as a latch (8 on landing + 4 every 0.5 s, −15/s). The pin ends only when
the raptor jumps off or its stamina runs out (also gone / dead / disabled / timeout) — not on the target's KO. The target
then rolls back up over 0.5 s ("getup") and walks on. Contact (PounceTest 1.2): when the front sweep misses, a
`PounceReach` sphere is swept straight down from the front point to feet level against pin targets only (a same-size
target sits under the lunge arc).

Attributes: `PouncePinRideHeight` (optional override). Diagnostics: owner client `PounceKind` (latch/pin),
`PounceContactProbe` (front/column); server `PounceMode` (latch/pin), `PounceClaimResult` adds busy (target already
pinned; "small" no longer used), `PounceReleaseReason` ko applies to latches only; on the target `PinnedAt` (server time),
`PinnedBy` (raptor name), `PinReleasedAt`; WalkTest `WalkTestState` adds pinned/getup.

### Pounce effects (PounceFX 1.0)
Every client, on each `PounceBiteAt`: the bite chomp (`BiteSoundId`) on the head at a higher pitch, a small flash at the
jaws and a damage number — landing hit (`PounceBiteAt` == `PounceLatchedAt`) big yellow (0.8 s, as a bite's), each 0.5 s
bite smaller orange (0.55 s, 0.65×). No chunks, wobble or camera punch.

| Attribute | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| PounceSoundPitch | 1.35 | Chomp PlaybackSpeed (higher = smaller, sharper chomp) |
| PounceSoundVolume | 0.7 | Chomp volume |

Diagnostics (client): `PounceFXHits`, `PounceFXLast` (land/bite), `PounceSoundLoaded`.

## Display raptor (tools/display_raptor_install.luau 1.0, WalkTest 1.4–1.5)
`Workspace.DinoArcade_Raptor.Raptor_v1.0_Display`, built from RaptorModelData with DinoModelBuilder (anchored, PivotOffset
90° so WalkTest's path follows the raptor's forward). Bitable, `DummyMaxHealth` 60, `DisplayName` "Display Raptor",
`WalkTestSpeed` 30 (walk out), `WalkTestReturnSpeed` 52 (run back), `WalkTestDistance` 100, `WalkTestTurnTime` 0.5,
`WalkTestKOHalfWidth` 0.9; route (−60, 0, 120) → (40, 0, 120). WalkTest 1.4 settings default to the 1.3 behaviour.

## Move direction (IdleAnimation 1.17 / WalkPose 3.4)
Steps follow the direction the body actually moves (body frame): backing up runs the step cycle in reverse, strafing
side-steps (hip roll, foot kept flat), diagonals mix both. Below 2 studs/s the step direction eases back to forward.

| Attribute | Default (Raptor) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| WalkDirectional | true | false = forward-only stepping (IdleAnimation 1.16 behaviour) |
| WalkSideStepReach | 1 (1.6) | Most side step × the hip's distance from the centre line (1 = feet meet it; > 1 = feet cross) |

Diagnostic (every client): `MoveDir` (degrees, 0 forward, 90 right, -90 left, ±180 back).
Raptor crouch walk (RaptorModelData 1.4; 1.5: CreepEnabled true, so C / B / touch crouches it too, besides exhaustion): CreepCrouch 4.3, CreepStepLength 12, CreepDuty 0.65,
CreepStrideStretch 1.15, CreepLift 2, CreepFootForward 1, CreepLean 6, CreepNeckDrop 20, CreepTailDrop 10,
CreepTailWhip 0.15, CreepArmTuck 35. T-Rex creep values unchanged.

## Island, bots and health (Island 1.0 / BotServer 1.0 / DinoHealthServer 1.0 / HealthBar 1.0 / BushView 1.0)
Island: `Workspace.DinoIsland` (tools/island_install.luau) — attributes `IslandVersion`, `IslandHalfSize` 185,
`IslandWanderLimit` 165; bushes = models with `DinoBush` = true; bot spawn markers carry `Species`.
Island 1.1: hiding spots are `DinoIsland.TallGrass` patches (`DinoBush` = true, `DinoTallGrass` = true, ModelStreamingMode Atomic),
blades 17–23 studs tall, so the T-Rex can hide too; trees in `DinoIsland.Trees` (JungleTree_n, Palm_n).
Bots (`DinoIsland.Bots`, "Bot_<Species>_<n>"): `IsBot`, `BotSpecies`, `Bitable`, `DummyMaxHealth` (Raptor 60, T-Rex 200),
`DisplayName`, `BiteEnabled` true. BotServer script attributes override: `BotSightRange` 60, `BotLoseRange` 90,
`BotHiddenLoseTime` 2, `BotWanderRadius` 60, `BotChaseSpeedMul` 0.9, `BotRespawnTime` 10, `BotKORemoveTime` 2.5.
Bite per species (BotServer SPECIES): Raptor 8 dmg / 1 s / reach 3; T-Rex 25 dmg / 1.6 s / reach 6.
Player health: Humanoid.MaxHealth = `DinoMaxHealth` or T-Rex 200 / Raptor 60; no regen; respawn 3 s.
Diagnostics: bot `BotState` (wander/idle/chase/search/bite/pinned/ko/getup), `BotTarget`, `BotBites`, `BotSpawnedAt`;
player character `Hidden`, `LastHitBy`, `LastHitDamage`, `LastHitAt`, `DiedAt`, `RespawnTime`, `DinoHealthVersion`,
`DinoMaxHealthSet`; client `HealthBarState` (normal/low/dead), `HealthShown`, `BushInside`; player `DinoDeaths`;
BotServer `BotServerVersion`, `BotServerState`, `BotCount`; BiteDummy `BiteDummyState` "island".

## Island 2.0 (island_v2_generator 1.0 / island_v2_install 1.0)
`Workspace.DinoIsland` 2.0 keeps the 1.x contract (folders Ground / Rocks / Trees / TallGrass / BotSpawns / Bots / EdgeWalls,
`Ground.Water` = the sea, top −0.8; `Trees` models with `Trunk*` / `Root` parts; `TallGrass` models with `DinoBush` +
`DinoTallGrass`; markers with `Species`), so BotServer / BushView / ShakeOffServer / RamServer / RamTest / StunClient are unchanged.

| Attribute (DinoIsland) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| IslandVersion | "2.0" | Map version |
| IslandHalfSize | 470 | Land reaches about ±470 studs (edge walls at ±561) |
| IslandWanderLimit | 460 | BotServer keeps wander targets inside abs(x), abs(z) ≤ this |
| IslandGeneratorVersion / IslandInstallVersion | "1.0" / "1.0" | Tools that built it |
| IslandBuildStage | "done" | Last install stage (begin / ground / water / rocks / trees / grass / done) |
| IslandGroundBlocks / IslandLakeBlocks / IslandBoulders | 2283 / 45 / 102 | Built counts (checked against tools/island_v2/manifest.json) |
| IslandTrees / IslandJungleTrees / IslandPines / IslandPalms | 405 / 126 / 255 / 24 | Trees |
| IslandTallGrassPatches / IslandTallGrassFields | 38 / 6 | Hunting fields; each patch also has `TallGrassField` (1–6) |
| IslandParts | 11012 | BaseParts in the island |
| IslandSpawnPos | (44, −0.4, 452) | Player spawn (south beach) |

Ground part names: `Grass` (forest floor), `Meadow`, `RockGround`, `Sand`, `Shallows` (sea shelf and every lake bed — the name
ShakeOffServer's water test reads), `LakeWater` (lake surfaces: no collision / queries), `Water`, `Seabed`. Verified in Play: bots
spawn and wander; `Hidden` true inside a patch, false 60 studs out; ShakeOffServer's ray reads all three lakes and the sea as water,
meadow and beach as dry; `ShakeOffTrunks` 1710.

## Island 3.0 (island_v3_generator 1.1 / island_v3_install 1.1)
Same contract as 2.0 (folders, part names, `Ground.Water` top −0.8, tree `Trunk*` / `Root` parts, `DinoBush` + `DinoTallGrass`
patches, `Species` markers), so no game script changed. New tree model `CoconutPalm_n` (ringed `Trunk` parts collide, `Crown`,
`Frond`, `Tuft`, `Coconut`). Lake beds are still named `Shallows`; the sea floor is several `Seabed` blocks around the lakes.

| Attribute (DinoIsland) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| IslandVersion | "3.0" | Map version |
| IslandHalfSize | 940 | Land reaches about ±940 studs (edge walls at ±1085) |
| IslandWanderLimit | 920 | BotServer keeps wander targets inside abs(x), abs(z) ≤ this |
| IslandGeneratorVersion / IslandInstallVersion | "1.1" / "1.1" | Tools that built it (installed with 1.0 payloads + the 1.1 seabed, identical result) |
| IslandBuildStage | "done" | Last install stage |
| IslandGroundBlocks / IslandLakeBlocks / IslandBoulders | 4725 / 49 / 109 | Built counts (checked against tools/island_v3/manifest.json) |
| IslandSeabedBlocks | 88 | Sea floor blocks (top −8) that leave the lakes open (1.1) |
| IslandTrees / IslandJungleTrees / IslandPines / IslandPalms | 405 / 114 / 21 / 270 | Trees (IslandPalms = coconut palms) |
| IslandTallGrassPatches / IslandTallGrassFields | 54 / 9 | Hunting fields; each patch also has `TallGrassField` (1–9) |
| IslandParts | 19849 | BaseParts in the island |
| IslandSpawnPos | (88, −0.4, 904) | Player spawn (south beach) |

Verified in Play: 4 bots spawn and wander; `Hidden` true inside a field patch; a dino in the middle lake stands on the bed at
−30.8 (no Seabed above it); ridge top 54 walkable; `ShakeOffTrunks` 3247; every column of ±1700 hits ground (no holes).

## Island 3.1 (island_v3_generator 1.2 / island_v3_install 1.2)
Same contract as 3.0. New ground part name `Trail` (the mountain trail; collides, studded top, no script reads it). The
middle and south lakes are one lake; the mountain's cliffs are `RockGround` in 14-stud bands up to the 200-stud summit.

| Attribute (DinoIsland) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| IslandVersion | "3.1" | Map version |
| IslandHalfSize / IslandWanderLimit | 940 / 920 | Unchanged |
| IslandGeneratorVersion / IslandInstallVersion | "1.2" / "1.2" | Tools that built it |
| IslandGroundBlocks / IslandLakeBlocks / IslandBoulders / IslandSeabedBlocks | 4578 / 48 / 120 / 89 | Built counts (tools/island_v3/manifest.json) |
| IslandTrees / IslandJungleTrees / IslandPines / IslandPalms | 357 / 100 / 6 / 251 | Trees |
| IslandTallGrassPatches / IslandTallGrassFields | 52 / 9 | Hunting fields |
| IslandParts | 18534 | BaseParts in the island |
| IslandSpawnPos | (88, −0.4, 904) | Player spawn (south beach) |

Verified in Play: a T-Rex player (40 studs long) walked the trail from the foot (8) to the summit (200) in 52 s; off the
trail a raptor's 11-stud leap reaches only the lowest bands (48); the joined lake reads as water all the way across (beds
−19 … −31); `Hidden` true in three fields; 4 bots; `ShakeOffTrunks` 2940.

## Island 3.2 (island_v3_generator 1.3 / island_v3_install 1.3)
Same contract and attributes as 3.1, with `IslandVersion` "3.2", `IslandGeneratorVersion` / `IslandInstallVersion` "1.3",
`IslandGroundBlocks` 4578, `IslandLakeBlocks` 48, `IslandParts` 18619. Lakes: beds (`Shallows`) −2.8 rim, then down to a
45-stud pit at −45.8; `LakeWater` parts are murky (52693B, transparency 0.1) from −0.8 to −46.2. Sea `Water` parts now
follow the 89 seabed rectangles (top −0.8 unchanged; ShakeOffServer still reads the first one's top).
Verified: pit beds −45.8 (joined lake 30 cells, north-east 15); a T-Rex in the pit stands at HRP −36 (fully under);
a 12 × 10 × 40 block 8 studs under the surface is invisible from the shore; `Hidden` in fields; 4 bots; trunks 2940.

## Bite dip, bot pounce and shake-off (BiteTest 1.3 / BiteServer 1.5 / BitePose 1.1 / BotServer 1.2 / ShakeOffServer 1.0 / StunClient 1.0)
Bite dip: at the press the bite looks for the smallest downward swing of the mouth about the neck (0–`BiteDipMax` 60°,
5° steps) that reaches a hitbox of another bitable dino; sent with the request, replicated as `BiteDip` (own client
`BiteDipPredicted`, `BiteDipChosen`); BitePose lowers the neck by `BiteDip − BiteLunge`; the server capsule is rotated
down by it. BiteTest 1.4 scores each dip by the whole rotated capsule (own client `BiteDipProbe` "capsule"). Bots do the same (T-Rex bot vs raptors).
Raptor bots pounce onto dinos ≥ 1.5× their size, 8–22 studs away, every 6 s (BotServer `BotPounceCooldown`); latched
8 + 4 / 0.5 s to the target's Humanoid for up to `BotLatchTime` 6.7 s. Bot attributes: `PounceStartedAt`, `PounceLatched`,
`PounceLatchedAt`, `PounceMode`, `PounceLatchTarget`, ObjectValue `PounceLatchPart`, `PounceBiteAt`, `PounceHitDamage`,
`PounceReleaseReason` (tired/gone/ko/water/rammed), `BotFlingClamps`, `BotShakeGoal` (tree/water); BotState adds
pounce/latched/leapoff/stunned/shake.
Shake-off (ShakeOffServer): on the raptor `ShakeOffReason` (water/rammed), `ShakeOffAt`, `StunnedUntil` (ram, 3 s); on
the shaking dino `ShakeOffCount`, `ShakeOffLast`, `ShakeOffLastAt`, `RamSpeed`, `InWater`. Ram = ≥ 0.75 × MoveRunSpeed
within the last 0.5 s and a blocking hitbox / HRP within 1.5 studs of a tree Trunk*/Root. Stun (StunClient): own client
`StunState` (none/stunned/getup), `StunLeft`; PounceInputResult / PounceServerResult "stunned".

## Tree ram and toss stun (RamTest 1.0 / RamServer 1.0 / RamPose 1.0 / IdleAnimation 1.19 / ShakeOffServer 1.1 / StunClient 1.1 / StunFX 1.0 / BotServer 1.3)
Settings (character): `RamEnabled` (T-Rex true, raptor false), `RamWindup` 0.4, `RamRange` 60, `RamStaminaCost` 20,
`RamCooldown` 6, `RamSpeedMul` 1.15, `RamMaxCharge` 3.5. Keys: E / gamepad DPadUp / touch "Ram".
Replicated (server): `RamStartedAt`, `RamTargetTree`, `RamCount`, `RamServerResult`, `RamDeniedAt` + `RamDenyReason`,
`RamImpactResult` (hit/waiting/farImpact/miss/noRam/late), `RamImpactDist`, `RamImpactPoint`, `RamImpactAt`,
`RamImpactCount`, `RamEndedAt`, `RamResult` (hit/miss/timeout; bots also cancel); StaminaServer `StaminaRamCount`,
`StaminaLastEvent` "ram".
Owner client: `RamTestState` / `RamLocalState` (off/ready/windup/charge/recoil/dead), `RamInputResult`
(sent/noTree/dead/stunned/latched/busy/air/exhausted/stamina/cooldown/denied), `RamTargetDist`, `RamContact`
(trunk/blocked/miss), `RamChargeSpeed`, `RamWalkSpeed` (charge/restored), `RamPredictedAt`, `RamLocalImpactAt`,
`RamLocalEndAt`. Every client (IdleAnimation): `RamState` (none/windup/charge/impact/fade), `RamSource`, `StunPose`
(none/kicking), `StunBlend`; StunFX `StunFXState` (none/stars/fading), `StunFXShown`.
Shake-off by ram (ShakeOffServer 1.1): on the raptor `StunTossFrom` (Vector3), `StunTossDistance` 15, `StunTossAt`, then
`StunnedUntil` (+3 s), `ShakeOffReason` "rammed", `ShakeOffAt`; on the rammer `ShakeOffRamImpacts`, `ShakeOffLastTossed`.
Script attribute `ShakeOffPassiveRam` (default false: running into a tree no longer shakes) + `ShakeOffPassiveRamOn`.
Toss: own client `StunState` adds "tossed", `StunTossDist`; bots `BotState` "tossed", `BotTossDist`. T-Rex bot:
`BotState` "ram", `BotRamPhase` (windup/charge/recoil/none). Latched raptor bots: `BotLatchNoCollide` (parts switched off).

## Ram only while latched on (RamServer 1.1 / RamTest 1.1)
User: "ram should only be able to happen when latched by a dino".
| Attribute (character) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| RamRequiresLatchOn | true | Ram only while a raptor is latched on this dino; false = RamTest / RamServer 1.0 behaviour |

Server: `LatchedOnCount` (every player character, every 0.1 s) = raptors (players + DinoIsland.Bots) with `PounceLatched`, not a pin,
`PounceLatchPart` inside this character. Request result / `RamDenyReason` adds "notLatchedOn". Owner client: `RamInputResult` adds
"notLatchedOn", `RamLatchGate` (open / closed / off). The Ram key (E / DPadUp) and touch button are bound only while the gate is open,
so E does nothing (or eats / drinks, SurvivalBars) when no raptor is on. Bot rams unchanged (BotServer 1.3 already needs a latched raptor).
Verified in Play: not latched → not bound, direct request denied "notLatchedOn"; latched (test latcher) → bound, ram "ok" → "hit".

## Eat / drink animation (EatPose 1.0 / IdleAnimation 1.20)
User: "currently there is no drinking or eating animation". Driven by `SurvivalAction` (SurvivalServer 1.0) on every client.
| Attribute (model) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| EatPoseEnabled | true | Layer on / off |
| EatBlendRate | 6 | Blend in / out per second |
| EatCrouch / EatLean | 0.8 / 8 | Body lowers (studs × scale) and pitches nose-down (°), feet planted |
| EatNeckDip / EatHeadDip | 20 / 20 | Eating neck / head dip (°) before the reach |
| EatTugRate / EatTug / EatShake / EatJawOpen | 1.2 / 14 / 10 / 35 | Tears per s, neck tug up (°), head shake (°), jaw open (°) |
| DrinkNeckDip / DrinkHeadDip | 18 / 14 | Drinking neck / head dip (°) before the reach |
| DrinkLapRate / DrinkLap / DrinkJawOpen | 2.4 / 5 / 14 | Laps per s, head bob (°), jaw open (°) |
| EatTailLift | 10 | Tail lift (°) |

Reach (IdleAnimation 1.20): extra neck dip that brings the lowest Head + Jaw point to the lake surface − 0.3 (drink) or the carcass
top (eat): 6° per stud off, at 3/s, −35..40°. Diagnostics (client): `EatPoseState` (none/eating/drinking/fade), `EatPoseBlend`,
`EatReach`, `EatMouthGap`. Verified in Play: T-Rex drinking at the lake rim settles at reach −2..−4° (mouth ±1 stud of −1.1);
raptor drinking settles at reach 0 (mouth −1.03); T-Rex eating a raptor carcass: head down, jaw opening / tug cycle.

## Eat / drink phases, vulnerability and dead look (SurvivalServer 1.1 / SurvivalBars 1.1 / EatPose 1.1 / DeadPose 1.0 / IdleAnimation 1.21)
User: drinking should take longer to get the head in; no refill until the mouth is in; eating "takes time to get into rendering the
player vulnerable"; dead dinos clearly dead; an eat prompt. Answers: move + turn locked (bite / roar / pounce cancel); drink 1 s, eat
1.5 s, up 0.5 s; dead pose; carcasses + KO'd bots + dead players.
| Attribute (character) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| DrinkEnterTime / EatEnterTime | 1.0 / 1.5 | Seconds from the press until the mouth is in (no refill before) |
| SurvivalRiseTime | 0.5 | Seconds getting back up after letting go (still locked) |
| DeadPoseEnabled / DeadBlendRate | true / 4 | Dead look on / blend speed (model attribute) |
| DeadLegSwing / DeadKnee / DeadAnkle / DeadArm | 38 / −18 / 25 / 45 | Dead pose limbs (°) |
| DeadNeck / DeadHead / DeadHeadRoll / DeadJaw / DeadTail | −18 / −12 / 10 / −32 / 6 | Dead pose neck, head, jaw, tail (°) |

Server (character): `SurvivalPhase` (none / lowering / eating / drinking / rising), `SurvivalPhaseAt`, `SurvivalKind` (eat / drink),
`SurvivalEnterTime`, `SurvivalRiseTime`, `SurvivalLocked`, `SurvivalLockAt`, `SurvivalInterruptedBy`; `SurvivalActionResult` adds
"interrupted". Carcass: `CarcassDeadPose`. Owner client: `SurvivalLockState` (none / predicted / locked / released),
`SurvivalEatPrompt`. Every client: `EatPoseState` adds lowering / rising, `EatReachIn`, `EatReachHover`, `EatAim`, `DeadPoseState`,
`DeadPoseBlend`.
Verified in Play: drink lowering 1.0 s with no refill → drinking refills → rising 0.5 s → none; W held during the lock = 0 studs moved,
21 studs in 0.8 s after it; T-Rex facing into the lake: snout under the surface; eat lowering 1.5 s no refill → eating refills, neck turned
35° into a carcass placed to the side; a roar during eating → "interrupted", lock off at once; KO'd raptor bot, carcass and a dead
T-Rex player all show the dead pose; eat prompt "[E] EAT / food 60 / 60" over the carcass.

## Eating visible + clearly dead (SurvivalBars 1.2 / SurvivalServer 1.2–1.3 / DeadPose 1.1 / IdleAnimation 1.22 / CarcassFlies 1.0)
User: "the eating animation hasnt shown up once"; dead dinos "lay on their side eyes open not even obvious that theyre dead".
Cause found: the eat animation played (SurvivalPhase eating, EatPoseBlend 1, hunger refilling) but the shoulder camera sits
behind and above the dino, so the lowered head and the carcass were hidden behind its own body. Answers: side view while eating;
X eyes + stronger pose + flies.
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SurvivalSideCam (character) | true | Camera swings to a 3/4 side view while locked (lowering / eating / drinking / getting up) |
| DeadEyesEnabled (model) | true | X eyes while dead |
| CarcassFliesEnabled (player) | true | Flies over carcasses |

Diagnostics: `SurvivalCamBlend` (owner client), `SurvivalHeadPos` (server), `DeadEyes` (every client: none / x / noHead), carcass
`CarcassDeadEyes`, `CarcassFliesVersion` / `CarcassFliesSwarms` (owner client).
Verified in Play (no teleport of the player, real bites): raptor bot killed by 3 bites → carcass → "[E] Hold to eat" → hold E → the
camera swings to the side, the T-Rex's head goes down into the carcass, hunger 27 → 56 → 83, the camera returns after getting up;
KO'd bot and carcass show X eyes (4 bars) and the jaw wide open; 6 flies over the carcass.

## Raptor packs, T-Rex avoidance, grudge flank, water (BotServer 1.4) and toss distance fix (StunClient 1.2)
User: "there should be a pack of raptors ... traveling in groups of 3. they should try to avoid the t-rex unless attacked then
they gang up on him", raptors "would prefer side swipes or latches not head", "they keep jumping into the water"; then "when i
ram into a tree when latched the raptors fly so far. lets keep it nearby relevant to the player". Answers: 2 packs = 6 raptors;
only the bitten raptor's pack, 20 s; keep ~40 studs from any T-Rex, raptor players attacked as before; flank + latch mix.

| Attribute (BotServer script) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BotPacksEnabled | true | Raptor bots in packs (false = v1.3: one raptor per marker, no pack behaviour) |
| BotAvoidWater | true | Raptor bots keep out of water |

Constants (BotServer): PACK_COUNT 2, PACK_SIZE 3, PACK_SPAWN_RING 6; FORMATION 7, CATCH_UP 20, FOLLOW_STOP 3; AVOID_RADIUS 40,
AVOID_FLEE 35, AVOID_HOLD 15; GRUDGE_TIME 20, GRUDGE_MATCH 1; FLANK_SIDE 7.5, FLANK_REAR 6, FLANK_NEAR 6; LATCH_MAX 2,
POUNCE_AIM_UP 4; DART_MAX 2.5; RETREAT_DIST 10, RETREAT_TIME 0.9; NO_HEAD = Head / Neck / Jaw; AIM_SEGMENTS = Torso / Tail1 /
Tail2; LATCH_SEGMENTS = Torso / Tail1–5; WATER_Y −0.8, WATER_CELL 2, WATER_STEP 4, SHORE_MARGIN 1; LEAP_LAND 12; DETOUR_STEP 20,
DETOUR_NEAR 6, DETOUR_TURN 20, DETOUR_KEEP 3. Water = ground ray (DinoIsland.Ground) hits Shallows / Seabed, ends below −0.8 or
hits nothing. Toss landing clamp: DinoIsland `IslandWanderLimit` (920) instead of 230 (BotServer tossOff, StunClient).

Diagnostics — bot: `BotPack` (Pack1/Pack2), `BotPackSlot` (1–3), `BotPackRole` (leader/follower), `BotPackGrudge` (player /
""), `BotPackGrudgeUntil` (server time / 0), `BotAvoiding` (T-Rex name / ""), `BotWaterAvoids`, `BotWanderWetSkips`,
`BotWanderRexSkips`, `BotDetourSide` (1/−1); `BotState` adds follow / avoid / flank / dart / retreat / shore / detour /
leaveWater. Marker: `BotPackUnused`. Script: `BotPacks`. StunClient (owner client): `StunClientVersion`, `StunTossLimit`.
Verified in Play: 6 raptors in Pack1 / Pack2, followers in formation; with the user playing the T-Rex, a real bite on Bot_Raptor_1
turned only Pack1 hostile; bites landed nearest Tail2 / LegL / Torso / ShinL and latches on legs (then restricted to torso / tail:
Tail3 / Torso after the change), never Head / Neck / Jaw; Pack2 fled at 38–39 studs and stayed ≥40 for 25 s; a bot put in the
shallows walked out (leaveWater); a follower 252 studs across a lake went around it along the shore with 0 of 100 samples in
water; a rammed latched raptor at z −487 landed 15.0 studs away (before: clamped to z −230).

## T-Rex bot water fixes and lake climb-out (BotServer 1.5)
User: "yes fix those" (the T-Rex bot's shake run aimed at the old island's shore; it was found stuck in a lake).
| Attribute (BotServer script) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BotTRexAvoidWater | true | T-Rex bot wanders on dry land and walks out of water when not chasing / shaking |

Constants: WATER_RING_STEP 8, WATER_SEARCH 400, SHAKE_INTO 6, SHAKE_REFRESH 2, SHAKE_MOVED 30; HOP_STUCK_SPEED 3, HOP_STUCK_TIME 0.6,
HOP_DIST 8, HOP_ARC 2, HOP_TIME 0.5, HOP_RISE 0.4. Shake water goal = nearest water spot (same test as ShakeOffServer) + 6 studs
in; none within 400: toward the island edge at IslandWanderLimit. Climb-out: a bot in leaveWater that gets less than 3 studs/s
farther over 0.6 s scrambles up (anchored rise, then over to the ground 8 studs toward dry land).
Diagnostics — bot: `BotShakeWaterDist`, `BotWaterHops`; `BotState` adds hop.
Verified in Play: T-Rex bot dropped on the −26.8 lake terrace got out in 4.4 s with 2 hops and stayed dry for 26 s; with a
raptor latched on (ram off for the test) its shake run found water 18 studs away and reached it in 1.2 s (InWater).

## Step-up assist (StepAssist 1.0 / StepAssistCore 1.0 / StepAssistServer 1.0) and IdleAnimation 1.25
Why: the DINO-7 terrain gate. The island is a 16-stud tile grid; between adjacent land tiles the step is 0 (9000 edges),
2 studs (8038), up to 3 (409), up to 5 (166) or more (2035, cliffs). Sand → Grass and Shallows → land are 2–2.4.
User's answers: step-up assist; all dinos.
| Attribute (DinoIsland) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| StepAssistEnabled | true | false = no lifts anywhere (client and server) |
| StepAssistMax | 2.6 | Highest ledge (studs above the ground under the root part) the assist lifts onto |

Rule: StepAssistCore header. Diagnostics (model attributes, written where it runs: owner client for player dinos, server
for bots / prey): `StepAssistState` (idle / blocked / lift / wall / stuck / off), `StepAssistCount`, `StepAssistLastHeight`,
`StepAssistLastAt`, `StepAssistWalls`, `StepAssistVersion` (character); script `StepAssistServerVersion`,
`StepAssistServerState`, `StepAssistTracked`.
Measured in Play (2.0 and 2.4 steps found by scanning the tile tops; a step = run-up cell, low cell, high cell, high cell):
- Correction to the first terrain report: that test walked the player with Humanoid:MoveTo from the client, which TurnLimit
  leaves at MoveDirection 0, so "Hatchling T-Rex 0/6" was the test, not the dino. With real W input and the assist off the
  Hatchling T-Rex (HipHeight 1.98) climbed 3 of 4 (2.0, 2.0, 2.4; one 2.4 not).
- Hatchling raptor (0.84), real W input: assist off 0 of 3 (stops at the face); assist on 6 of 6, one lift each.
- Raptor clone at scale 0.4 walked by server MoveTo (as bots / prey move): assist off 0 of 4; assist on 6 of 6, one lift
  each (a fixed 0.6-stud forward nudge needed two lifts; the nudge is now the ledge distance + 0.4).
- Real bots over one Play session: Bot_Raptor_1 2 lifts (2.0), Bot_Raptor_4/5/6 2 lifts each (2.4), no walls.
- Steps of 3 studs and more are not lifted (StepAssistMax 2.6); raise StepAssistMax to include them.
IdleAnimation 1.25: the template copy in StarterCharacterScripts (RunContext Client) errored every frame in v1.24's
refitScale; it now returns unless the parent is a Model. Client and server logs had 0 errors from it after the fix.

## Size-aware bots (BotServer 1.6, DINO-9)
Red-team answer "size-aware bots": bots stay adults but react to the player's growth stage. A player counts as adult
unless its character has GrowthState "ready" and a GrowthStage number.
| Attribute (BotServer script) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BotSizeAwareEnabled | true | false = BotServer 1.5 behaviour and damage exactly |

Constants: BOT_AVOID_MIN_STAGE 2 (a T-Rex player below Juvenile is not avoided; packs may chase / bite / pounce it),
BOT_PLAYER_HIT_CAP 0.4 (bot damage per bite / latch land / latch tick ≤ 0.4 × the player's MaxHealth). Diagnostics: bot
`BotAvoidSkipSmall`, `BotLastHitCapped`; script `BotWanderSkipSmall`; `LastHitDamage` / `PounceHitDamage` carry the damage
actually dealt.
Verified in Play:
- Hatchling T-Rex player (80 HP) 30 studs from Pack1: all three targeted him (BotAvoidSkipSmall counting), bit 8 each
  (uncapped, 8 < 32): 80 → 56; they lost him when the bites knocked him into a bush (Hidden, unchanged rule).
- Same player at Lv6 Juvenile, pack moved 25 studs away: BotState "avoid", BotAvoiding = the player.
- Hatchling raptor (24 HP) in front of the T-Rex bot: bite 25 → 9.60 (BotLastHitCapped true), 24 → 14.4.
- BotSizeAwareEnabled false: the next bite dealt 25 (capped false) and killed it.
- Seen, not changed: the chasing T-Rex bot walked onto the hatchling raptor (0.8 studs flat, mouth 18.5 studs above its
  hitboxes) and could not bite it until the raptor was in front of its snout (v1.2 chase / dipped bite).

## Bite auto-aim (BiteTest 1.5 / BiteServer 1.7 / BitePose 1.2 / IdleAnimation 1.23)
User: "the t-rex bite isnt consistent enough. i can have raptors laying right in front of me and i bite and it misses";
"maybe a target lock system?". Answers: auto-aim each bite, ±45° cone.
Root cause (measured): the bite capsule (radius BiteRange 5 around the line BiteReachBack 8 behind the mouth front to 2.5
ahead) only dipped about the neck, never turned, so it reached about ±6 studs either side of the T-Rex's centre line; a
lying raptor 12 ahead / 7 to the side was a miss (dip 0, nothing in reach). The dip chosen was also the smallest that just
reached (the capsule's edge), so movement during the 0.25 s wind-up + strike and the 3-stud lunge could push it out.

| Attribute (character) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| BiteAimAssist | true | Auto-aim each bite (false = BiteTest 1.4 dip only) |
| BiteAimCone | 45 | Degrees either side of the facing a target may be |
| BiteAimMax | 45 | Most degrees the bite turns (client, server and pose) |
| BiteAimSlack | 2 | Extra studs the server allows for the aimed target |

Constants (BiteTest): AIM_SCAN 45 (studs to a target's HumanoidRootPart), AIM_YAW_WEIGHT 0.05, AIM_DIST_WEIGHT 0.02, DIP_STEP 5.
Diagnostics — owner client: `BiteAimTarget`, `BiteAimGap`, `BiteAimYawChosen`, `BiteAimYawPredicted`, `BiteTestVersion`;
server (replicated): `BiteAimYaw`, `BiteAimTargetName`, `BiteHitSource` adds "aim"; script `BiteServerVersion`.
Verified in Play (real clicks, T-Rex player standing still): lying raptor 12 ahead / 7 right — v1.6 miss, v1.7 hit (yaw −28.6,
client claim); 14 / 10 left hit (yaw 29.8); 9 / 9 right hit (yaw −45); 20 / 12 right hit (tail, gap 2.8); standing, fleeing
raptor 14 / 5 hit (source "aim"); 3 ahead / 15 to the side (outside the cone) — no aim, miss. The mouth swings toward the
aimed side (+4.6 studs right for a target on the right).

## Food and water heal (SurvivalServer 1.4)
User: "when you fill up your hunger meter it fills up your health by half. if you fill up your drink meter it fills it also
by half". Answers: as you eat / drink; capped at max health, no other limits.
| Attribute (character) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SurvivalHealEnabled | true | Eating / drinking heals |
| EatHealFraction | 0.5 | Share of max health a full 0 → HungerMax meal heals (per meter point: 0.5 % for 100) |
| DrinkHealFraction | 0.5 | Share of max health a full 0 → ThirstMax drink heals |

Heal per tick = meter points added × fraction / meter max × MaxHealth, only in the eating / drinking phase (same ticks as the
refill), never above MaxHealth. Diagnostics: `SurvivalHealed`, `SurvivalEatHealed`, `SurvivalDrinkHealed`, `SurvivalLastHeal`,
`SurvivalLastHealAt`.
Verified in Play (real hold E): T-Rex 40 / 200, thirst 0.9 → drank to full (+101.4 water) → healed exactly 101.4 (a T-Rex bot
bite of 25 landed meanwhile: 116.4); hunger 1, ate a whole raptor carcass (60 food) → 40 → 100 (+60).

## Prey (PreyModels 1.0 / PreyHop 1.0 / IslandWater 1.0 / PreyServer 1.0 / BiteTest 1.6 / BiteTargetHealth 1.2)
Plan: docs/plans/PREY_v1.0.md (DINO-11 → 14); looks: docs/mockups/prey_looks.jpg.
| Prey | Health = meat | Walk / run | Group | Alarm | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Compy | 15 | 14 / 30 | 3–5 | 30 | whole group flees 4 s, tired 3 s, repeat while threatened |
| Chicken | 8 | 6 / 10 | 2–4 | 15 | hops away 3 s |
| Crab | 8 | 6 / 10 | 2–4 | 15 | hops away 3 s, sideways |

| Attribute (PreyServer script) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| PreyEnabled | true | false = every prey removed, nothing spawns |

Diagnostics: model `PreyState` (graze / flee / tired / hop / ko / pinned / getup), `PreyGroup`, `PreyWaterCuts`,
`PreySpawnedAt`, `PreyKind`, `IsPrey`, `PreyHopState` (client), `TargetBarSkipped`; script `PreyServerVersion`,
`PreyServerState`, `PreyCount`, `PreyCompies`, `PreyGroups`, `PreyZones`, `PreyZonesActive`, `PreySpawned`,
`PreyDespawned`, `PreyKOs`.
Plan changes found while building: PreyHop is `PreyHop.server.luau` + RunContext Client meta (a `.client.luau` becomes a
LocalScript, which does not run inside a Workspace model); the snack legs / feet are a second segment "LegL" (with them
in the Torso segment the blocking Torso hitbox sat on the ground and chickens dragged at 1–2 studs/s instead of 10).
Verified in Play:
- Zones "Compy 6 · Chicken 6 · Crab 6"; near the player 5 compies + 3 chickens at 138–156 studs; hitboxes 17 (compy) /
  2 (snacks); no bars on prey; 0 errors.
- Player 25 studs from compies: whole group flee at 30 for 4 s, tired at 14 for 3 s, then graze.
- Player 10 studs from a crab: hop at 10 for 3 s, then graze. 0 of 478 prey position samples in water over 50 s.
- Hatchling T-Rex (real click): auto-aim chose the chicken, 10 damage → KO, +10 damage XP +4 kill XP; carcass 8 food;
  eating it: hunger +8. A compy: 2 bites of 11 → KO, +7.5 kill XP.
- Hatchling raptor (real F): pin on a chicken, KO while pinned, stays down; Space releases → removed → carcass 8.
- PreyEnabled false → 0 prey, counters 0, no carcasses; true → back at the next 20 s top-up.
- Player moved ~420 studs away: two groups (8 prey) removed at the 30 s mark; the group still within 250 stayed.
- 15 compies animating near the player: client 60 fps (16.7 ms avg, 19.4 ms worst; same as with 5). Studio caps at
  60 fps, so the headroom above that is not measured.
Not tested: a real chase (only bites on held prey); other players seeing the hop animation.

## Level-up celebration (LevelUpFX 1.0 / GrowthBar 1.1 / GrowthServer 1.1)
User: "for growth leveling up we need an animation because when i was playing i was totally unaware that i leveled up to
level 6". Picked option C of docs/mockups/levelup_options.html (effect on the dino + screen banner + smooth grow); sound: a
chime found in the Creator Store ("UI - Level Up" by SodaBreadle, rbxassetid://112485797063762, 1.54 s).
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| LevelUpFXEnabled | character | true | false = no effect on the dino |
| LevelUpSoundId | character | rbxassetid://112485797063762 | chime; "" = silent |
| GrowthBarBanner | character | true | false = GrowthBar 1.0 small messages |
| GrowSmoothTime | GrowthServer script | 0.8 | seconds a stage-up takes to grow the body; 0 = instant |

Diagnostics: `LevelUpFXVersion`, `LevelUpFXCount`, `LevelUpFXLast`, `LevelUpFXLastAt`, `LevelUpSoundLoaded` (client);
`GrowthBarBannerShown`, `GrowthBarBannerAt` (client); `GrowthGrowing` (server).
Verified in Play (Hatchling T-Rex, screenshots): +16 food → "LEVEL UP!" banner + "LV 2 · +1 skill point · 86 max health",
gold column, ring segments, sparkles and glow on the dino; +109 → "JUVENILE!" + "Bigger body · 112 max health · bite 14",
scale on the server 0.400 → 0.492 → 0.555 → 0.585 → 0.598 → 0.600 over 0.8 s, feet on the ground after (0.01 studs),
33 client re-fit steps, chime loaded, effect folders cleaned up, 0 errors on client and server.

## Heal per fill (SurvivalServer 1.5)
Bug (user): "when i fill up both meters of hunger and thirst then get in a fight and go fill up my meters immediately
afterwards, it caps my dino health regen ... everytime i fill both of the meters it should make me full health".
Cause: v1.4 healed per meter point (amount / Max × 0.5 × MaxHealth); meters drain slowly (480 s / 360 s full → empty), so
a refill after a fight added only the few points that had drained (12.5 points after a minute = +6 %).
| Attribute (character) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SurvivalHealPerFill | true | Each fill heals its fraction however full the meter was; false = v1.4 per-point rule |

Per tick: heal = (fraction − this fill's healed share) × points added / (Max − meter before the tick) × MaxHealth; the share
resets when the meter reaches Max. Diagnostics: `SurvivalEatFillHealed`, `SurvivalDrinkFillHealed`, `SurvivalHealMode`,
`SurvivalFillsCompleted`.
Verified in Play (Hatchling T-Rex, 80 max): HP 20, Hunger 90, Thirst 88 → ate a raptor carcass to full: 20 → 60 (27.3,
34.1, 41.9, 53.0 on the way) → drank to full: 60 → 86 / 86 (max had grown to 86 from the eat / drink XP; capped at max).
Thirst 70, HP 10: three presses (stop, press again, to full) → fill shares 0.192, 0.373, then 0.5 total = one 50 %.

## Goals (GoalDefs 1.0, DINO-18)
User: "something about it makes the game boring off the bat. feels like im just freely running around unless i walk into
range of a bot dinosaur". Picked option A of docs/mockups/goals_options.html (3 goals listed, any order). Plan
docs/plans/GOALS_v1.0.md, ADR-003. GoalDefs is maths only (no attributes); GoalServer 1.0 applies it.
| Stage | Goals (pick order; T-Rex only / Raptor only marked) |
|---|---|
| 1 Hatchling | Catch 2 chickens or crabs (m) · Eat 25 food (s) · Drink 25 water (s) · Hide in a bush or tall grass for 10 s (s) · Pounce-kill a chicken or crab (m, Raptor) |
| 2 Juvenile | Catch 3 compies (m) · Land 5 bites (s) · Eat 50 food (s) · Drink 50 water (s) · Roar 3 times (s, T-Rex) |
| 3 Sub-adult | Down a raptor (b) · Deal 150 bite damage (m) · Catch 5 prey (m) |
| 4 Adult | Down 3 raptors (b, T-Rex) · Down the T-Rex (b, Raptor) · Deal 300 bite damage (m) · Eat 100 food (s) |

Reward XP = floor(share × xpToNext(min(level, 19)) + 0.5), share s 0.35 / m 0.6 / b 1 (Lv 2 medium = 12, Lv 17 big = 280).
Verified in Studio Edit: GoalDefs.spec 1.0 PASS 46.

## Goal XP (GrowthServer 1.2, DINO-19)
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| GoalXpEarned | character | 0 | Cumulative goal XP written by GoalServer 1.0; each increase is given as XP |
| XpPerGoal | GrowthServer script | 1 | Multiplier on goal XP; 0 = goals pay nothing |

`GrowthLastXp` reads "goal +n". Verified in Play (Hatchling T-Rex): GoalXpEarned 0 → 12 = "goal +12", XP 0 → 12, no repeat
next tick; +12 while GrowthEnabled false = nothing, also not after re-enabling; +12 with XpPerGoal 0 = nothing; unchanged:
food +3 = "eat +3" (level 2), bite 4 = "bite +4", water +4 = "drink +2", crab kill (8 HP) = "kill +4".

## Goal server (GoalServer 1.0, DINO-20)
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| GoalsEnabled | GoalServer script | true | false = slot attributes removed, GoalState "disabled", nothing counted (records kept) |
| GoalReplaceDelay | GoalServer script | 2.5 | Seconds a finished goal stays (done) before the next one takes its slot |

State (player, server): `GoalState` (waiting / running / paused / disabled), `GoalStageName`, per slot i = 1..3: `Goal<i>Id`,
`Goal<i>Text`, `Goal<i>Have`, `Goal<i>Need`, `Goal<i>Xp` (reward at the current level), `Goal<i>Size` (s / m / b), `Goal<i>Done`,
`Goal<i>DoneAt`. Character: `GoalXpEarned` (cumulative goal XP, read by GrowthServer 1.2).
Diagnostics: player `GoalsCompleted`, `GoalLastDone` ("<text> +n"), `GoalLastDoneAt`, `GoalLastEvent` ("fill TRex stage 1",
"h_eat +20", "done h_eat +7", "replace h_eat -> h_hide", "stage 1->2 kept 0"); script `GoalServerVersion`, `GoalCompletedTotal`.
Verified in Play (Hatchling T-Rex): spawn h_snack / h_eat / h_drink (XP 9 / 5 / 5 at Lv 1, rewritten as the level rose);
food +20 → 20/25, +10 → done "+7" (Lv 2: 0.35 × 20), GrowthLastXp "goal +7", replaced by h_hide 2.5 s later; a Compy kill
and another player's chicken kill did not count, two own chicken / crab kills → done "+15"; standing in tall grass (real
BotServer Hidden) counted 1 … 10 s → done; finished h_snack replaced by h_eat (not h_snack again); +120 XP → Lv 6, "stage
1->2 kept 0", j_compy / j_bites / j_eat (XP 69 / 40 / 40); death → Lv 1, "stage 2->1 kept 0", h_* again; respawn at the same
stage kept h_eat 10/25; GoalsEnabled off → 0 slot attributes, food eaten meanwhile not counted, on → 10/25 again; growth off
→ "paused", not counted; switch to Raptor → its own record ("fill Raptor stage 1"), back to T-Rex → h_eat 10/25 kept; a
KilledAt 5 s old when first seen → not counted; goal finished 0.25 s before death → the dead character still credited
"goal +9"; replace ran after the respawn. No GoalServer warnings.

## Goal tracker (GoalTracker 1.0 / GoalServer 1.1, DINO-21)
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| GoalPopEnabled | character | true | false = no "GOAL DONE!" pop (the list still updates) |

Diagnostics (character, client): `GoalTrackerVersion`, `GoalTrackerState` (shown / hidden), `GoalPopShownAt` (server time of
the finished goal last popped). GoalServer 1.1: a done row's `Goal<i>Xp` = the XP paid.
Verified in Play (Hatchling T-Rex, 1676 × 736 viewport, screenshots): list on the right below the player-list area with
3 rows, progress strips filling (12/25, 5/25); finishing "Eat 25 food" → gold outline + ✓, "GOAL DONE! · Eat 25 food · +5 XP"
at 20% and the "LEVEL UP!" banner at 34% at the same moment without overlap; 2.5 s later "Hide in a bush or tall grass for
10 s" slid into the slot (text shrunk to fit); GoalPopEnabled false → no pop for the drink goal; GoalsEnabled false →
GoalTrackerState hidden; respawn → one GoalTracker gui, 3 rows shown, no stale pop. Not checked: the Roblox player list
itself (not in Studio screen captures, and Studio Play has one player).

## Grass cover maths (GrassCover 1.0, DINO-24)
User: "This is the reason for grass and creep walk. Allow a way for that mechanic to be used for ambushing that's why I
want more tall grass". Option A of docs/mockups/ambush_options.html; plan docs/plans/AMBUSH_v1.0.md; ADR-004.
GrassCover is maths only (BotServer 1.7 applies it). Constants: TOP T-Rex 20.0 standing / 14.0 creeping, raptor 5.5 / 3.3
(top of the head above the ground at scale 1, measured in Play), × the growth scale; DEFAULT_HEIGHT 17 (a patch without
GrassHeight = today's tall grass); EDGE 4 studs (creeping only); MARGIN 0.5 (as the v1.6 box test).
| Dino | Top standing / creeping | Tall grass 17 | Short grass 10 |
|---|---|---|---|
| T-Rex Hatchling (0.4) | 8.0 / 5.6 | hidden | hidden |
| T-Rex Juvenile (0.6) | 12.0 / 8.4 | hidden | creep to hide |
| T-Rex Sub-adult (0.8) | 16.0 / 11.2 | hidden | seen |
| T-Rex Adult (1.0) | 20.0 / 14.0 | creep to hide | seen |

## Ambush grass (grass_ambush_install 1.0, DINO-25)
| Attribute | On | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| GrassKind | patch model | "tall" / "short" |
| GrassHeight | patch model | 17 / 10: the height GrassCover compares the head with (island patches without it count as 17) |

Verified in Studio Edit (2026-10-27): plan → place → second place refused → remove (TallGrass back to 52) → place again with the
denser short grass (2.5-stud grid; the planned 3.5 looked like a thin clump, ~25 blades): tall 34 (BotSpawn_1 6, BotSpawn_2 6,
BotSpawn_3 4, lake 18), short 90 (avg 36.7 blades, box ~20 × 14 × 20), parts 18,621 → 24,048 (+5,427). Spots rejected while
planning: water / rock 1200, slope 395, tree 122, boulder 14, other patches 312. Screenshots: a lake shore lined with tall
grass and short clumps on the open field; a short patch next to a tree.

## Ambush hiding (BotServer 1.7 / CoverHint 1.0, DINO-26 / DINO-27)
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| AmbushRulesEnabled | BotServer script | true | false = v1.6 rule (root inside a grass box), HiddenReason "legacy" |
| CoverHintEnabled | character | true | false = the hint line never shows |

State (character, server, every 0.1 s): `Hidden` (new rule), `HiddenReason` (inside / edge / tooTall / open / legacy), `HiddenTop`

`AmbushPatchesTall` (86 = 52 island + 34 new), `AmbushPatchesShort` (90). Client: `CoverHintVersion`, `CoverHintShown`.
Verified in Play (2026-10-27):
- Adult T-Rex (growth off): standing in a new tall patch → Hidden false, tooTall, top 20, grass 17, hint; creeping → Hidden
  true, inside, top 14; creeping 3 studs outside an isolated new tall patch and an island patch → Hidden true, "edge";
  standing there → open + hint; beach → open, grass 0, no hint; short patch standing / creeping → tooTall (20 / 14 > 10), no
  hint; AmbushRulesEnabled false → Hidden true "legacy"; back on → tooTall.
- Hatchling T-Rex (0.4) in short grass → Hidden true (top 8 ≤ 10); hatchling raptor → true (top 2.2); juvenile T-Rex (0.6)
  in short grass standing → tooTall + hint (screenshot: the line sits above "LV 6 · JUVENILE" with no overlap), creeping →
  hidden, hint gone; CoverHintEnabled false → line not shown.
- Real pack (BotSpawn_2, 3 raptors): a creeping adult T-Rex in AmbushGrass_tall_7 stayed Hidden while the raptors wandered
  and idled 13–18 studs away (no avoid, 12 s); standing up with the nearest raptor at 30 studs → all three "avoid"
  (BotAvoiding = the player) within 0.75 s and ran to 55–94 studs. BushView made the new patch see-through
  (LocalTransparencyModifier 0.65). No new warnings.

## Roaming spot maths (BotRoam 1.0, DINO-28)
User: "lets just forget the scale with your growth thingy and just have roaming bots on the map". Option B of
docs/mockups/roaming_options.html (random spots); plan docs/plans/ROAMING_v1.0.md; ADR-005. BotRoam is maths only (no
attributes; BotServer 1.8 applies it). Constants: STEP 4, MAX_RISE 3, MIN_TOP −0.8, MAX_TOP 20, LIMIT 920, MIN_DIST 250,
MAX_DIST 650, TRIES 40, PLAYER_DIST 150, RESPAWN_TRIES 200. Verified in Studio Edit: BotRoam.spec 1.0 PASS 32 (the spec is
also kept as ServerStorage.DinoArcadeTools.BotRoam_spec).

## Roaming bots (BotServer 1.8, DINO-29)
| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| BotRoamEnabled | BotServer script | true | false = the 9 roam bots are removed (no respawn); true = they spawn again. The 7 marker bots are never touched |

Bot: `BotRoamGroup` (Roam1..Roam5), `BotRoamState` (stay / travel), `BotRoamSpot` ("x, z"), `BotRoamGroupTrips`,
`BotRoamSidestepAt`; roam packs use `BotPack` Roam1..Roam4. Script: `BotRoamState` (on / off), `BotRoamGroups` (5), `BotRoamBots`,
`BotRoamTrips`, `BotRoamPicks`, `BotRoamPickFails`, `BotRoamStuck`, `BotRoamSidesteps`, `BotRoamRegroups`.
Constants: ROAM_STAY 20–40 s, ROAM_ARRIVE 40, ROAM_STUCK 20 studs / 25 s, ROAM_SPAWN_AVOID 250, sidestep 12 studs for 1.5 s
after < 3 studs in 1.5 s, regroup > 150 studs from the leader for 20 s (only out of every player's 150-stud range).
Verified in Play (2026-10-27, BotSightRange 0, adult T-Rex at the spawn):
- 16 bots (7 marker + 9 roam), roam groups spawned at -213,-355 / -335,844 / 834,-328 / 495,357 / -661,344.
- First run: 8 trips in 90 s, but a Roam1 follower stood 60 s+ against JungleTree_63 (straight follow line blocked) →
  added sidestep + regroup. Second run, 5 minutes: 32 trips, 1 pick fail, 0 stuck, 42 sidesteps, 0 regroups, no roam bot
  below Y 0; net moves 108–766 studs; packs together (members within 25 studs). Third run: every group 2 trips in 117 s.
- KO of a Roam2 follower with no player near → back 6 studs from the group spot (ring); KO of the lone Roam3 with the
  player 30 studs away → back 601 studs from the player.
- BotRoamEnabled false → 0 roam / 7 marker bots, nothing respawned in 12 s; true → 9 back.
- BotSightRange 60, hatchling T-Rex (Lv 1) placed 45 studs from Roam1 → all three chased and bit within 1 s (killed it:
  the v1.6 hit cap is 0.4 × 80 per bite). No new warnings.

## Bot hunt rules (BotHunt 1.0, DINO-30)
User: "the bots need to hunt too tho when theyre in range of prey or fight if they get in range of other bot animals";
answers: predator rules, the loser flees at low health, the killer eats after a kill, the nearest target wins. Plan
docs/plans/BOTHUNT_v1.0.md, ADR-006. Maths only (BotServer 1.9 applies it). Constants: FLEE_FRAC 0.3, REGEN_WAIT 10 s,
REGEN_RATE 0.01 / s. Verified in Studio Edit: BotHunt.spec 1.0 PASS 29 (copy in ServerStorage.DinoArcadeTools.BotHunt_spec).

## Bot hunting and fights (BotServer 1.9, DINO-31)
Script `BotServer` (toggles, default true; read live):
- `BotHuntEnabled` — bots hunt prey (DinoIsland.Prey). `BotFightEnabled` — bots fight bots (BotHunt 1.0 rules) and flee.
- `BotRegenEnabled` — a bot not hit for 10 s heals 1% of DummyMaxHealth per second.
Script counters (reset to 0 at start): `BotHuntKills`, `BotFightKills`, `BotFightBites`, `BotFlees` (flee entries),
`BotEats` (meals started), `BotHuntGiveUps` (unreachable animals dropped).
Bot model:
- `BotAnimalTarget` (string, the prey / bot model name or ""), `BotAnimalBites`, `BotAnimalKills`, `BotAnimalGiveUps`.
- `BotFleeing` (bool), `BotEatState` ("toFood" / "lowering" / "eating" / "rising" / "none").
- `BotState` adds "hunt" (chasing prey), "fight" (chasing a bot), "flee", "toFood", "eat".
- Eat pose (IdleAnimation 1.21 clone on the bot): `SurvivalKind` "eat", `SurvivalPhase`, `SurvivalPhaseAt`, `SurvivalEnterTime`
  1.5, `SurvivalRiseTime` 0.5, `SurvivalNearCarcass` (the carcass whose CarcassFrom = the kill; cleared when the meal ends).
Bitten animal (prey or bot): `DummyHealth` -= the bot's bite damage, `LastHitBy` (bot name), `LastHitDamage`, `LastHitAt`.
Kill by a bot: `KilledBy` = bot name, `KilledByUserId` 0, `KilledWith` "bite", `KilledAt` (no player credit).
Conditions: flee = DummyHealth / DummyMaxHealth < 0.3 and a bot that may attack it within 40; give-up = moved < 3 studs in
3 s with no bite started, or 20 s chasing with no bite landing (skip that animal 15 s). A bitten pack member's pack gets a
grudge on the biter for 20 s (fights it; nearestRex does not flee from it).

## Stat sheet (StatSheet 1.0, MDA-1, Mecha Dino Arena)
Pure module with no attributes of its own. StatServer 1.0 (MDA-2) writes the character attributes it computes.
- Stats: Health, Attack, Defense, Speed, Support. Stamina is not a stat (StaminaPounceOnly: running never drains).
- Natural build types: T-Rex = Bulky (start 9/7/7/4/1), Raptor = Roamer (start 3/4/3/9/1).
- Per added point (placeholders until the stat trees):
  - Health: +15 MaxHealth.
  - Attack: BiteDamage +2, PounceLandDamage +2, PounceTickDamage +1.
  - Speed: MoveWalkSpeed / MoveRunSpeed / MoveCreepSpeed +10% of the species' own value.
  - Defense: StatDamageTakenMul −0.05.
  - Support: none.
- Cap: +10 added per stat.

## Class stats on player dinos (StatServer 1.0, MDA-2, Mecha Dino Arena)
Script `StatServer`:
- `StatEnabled` (default true): false writes the base values back.
- `ArenaAdultSpawns` (default true): sets GrowthServer `GrowthEnabled = false` at start.
- Diagnostics: `ArenaAdultSpawnsApplied` (true / false / "noGrowthServer"), `StatServerVersion`, `StatApplies` (count).
Player input (written by the stat trees in part 3): `StatAdded_Health`, `StatAdded_Attack`, `StatAdded_Defense`,
`StatAdded_Speed`, `StatAdded_Support` (ints; clamped by StatSheet 1.0; a change re-applies live).
Character:
- `StatState` ("waiting" / "noSheet" / "noHealth" / "growthOn" / "disabled" / "ready").
- `StatClass` ("Bulky" / "Roamer"), `StatAbilities` (comma list, e.g. "Roar,Ram").
- `StatPoints_<Stat>` (start + added), `StatAdded_<Stat>` (after clamping), `StatAddedClamped`.
- `StatBase_<key>` / `StatBase_MaxHealth` (adult base), `StatDamageTakenMul` (Defense), `StatAppliedAt`, `StatServerVersion`.
- Written stats: Humanoid.MaxHealth (health fraction kept after spawn), `BiteDamage`, `PounceLandDamage`,
  `PounceTickDamage`, `MoveWalkSpeed`, `MoveRunSpeed`, `MoveCreepSpeed` (only those the character has).
While GrowthState is "ready" (growth on), nothing is written. A `StatDamageTakenMul` already written stays as it was.

## Defense on bot hits (BotServer 1.10, MDA-3, Mecha Dino Arena)
- Script `BotServer` `BotDefenseEnabled` (default true): bot damage to a player (bite, latch land, latch tick) is
  multiplied, after the growth cap, by the player character's `StatDamageTakenMul` (StatServer 1.0). Missing / invalid → 1.
- Bot diagnostic: `BotLastHitDefenseMul` (the multiplier used on the last hit).

## Class card (ClassCard 1.0, MDA-4, Mecha Dino Arena)
Character attributes (this client):
- `ClassCardEnabled` (default true): false hides the card.
- `ClassCardFullTime` (default 8 s): how long the full card stays open after it first appears.
- Diagnostics: `ClassCardVersion`, `ClassCardState` ("waiting" / "noSheet" / "hidden" / "full" / "collapsed").
Reads (from StatServer 1.0): `Species`, `StatState`, `StatClass`, `StatAbilities`, `StatPoints_*`, `StatAdded_*`,
`StatDamageTakenMul`, `BiteDamage`, `MoveWalkSpeed`, `MoveRunSpeed`, and Humanoid.MaxHealth.

## Arena scope (ArenaScope 1.0, BotServer 1.11, Mecha Dino Arena)
- Script `ArenaScope` (check only): `ArenaScopeVersion`, `ArenaScopeMismatches`; `ArenaScope_<ScriptName>` = "on" /
  "off" / "mismatch" / "missing"; `ArenaScope_BotHiding` = "off" / "mismatch".
- Switched off in Mecha (script `Enabled = false`; repo `.meta.json`): SurvivalServer, SurvivalBars, PreyServer,
  CarcassFlies, GoalServer, GoalTracker, CreepServer, CreepTest, CoverHint, BushView, RoarServer, RoarTest, RoarFX,
  BiteDummy, ClassCard. Their attributes are no longer written in Mecha.
- Script `BotServer` `BotHidingEnabled` (default true; Mecha false): false → every player `Hidden = false`,
  `HiddenReason = "off"`, `CoverHint = false`.

## Arena HUD (ArenaStatus 1.0, ArenaTouch 1.0, ArenaRules 1.0, ArenaScope 1.1; MDA-6..9, Mecha Dino Arena)
Character attributes (this client):
- ArenaStatus: `ArenaStatusVersion`, `ArenaStatusMenu` ("closed" / "open"), `ArenaStatusLastPick` (species sent),
  `ArenaStatusStamina` ("shown" while PounceLatched / "hidden").
- ArenaTouch: `ArenaTouchVersion`, `ArenaTouchState` ("off" without touch / "on"), `ArenaTouchLastPress` (Bite / Run /
  Ram / Pounce / Leap), `ArenaTouchCASMode` ("overlay" / "noGui"), `ArenaTouchJumpHidden` (true / "notFound").
Server:
- Script `ArenaRules`: `ArenaRulesVersion`, `ArenaNoDefaultJump` (default true).
- Character `ArenaJumpRule`: "blocked" (JumpPower 0), "leap" (JumpEnabled), "off".
Switched off in Mecha (Arena scope 1.1): HealthBar, SpeciesPicker, StaminaBar.

## Auto-run (SprintTest 1.5, ArenaRules 1.1, ArenaTouch 1.1; Mecha Dino Arena)
- Character `AutoRun` (set by ArenaRules from its script attribute `ArenaAutoRun`, default true): SprintTest runs
  without the key; `Sprinting` true, `MoveSpeedSource` "run". Roar / exhausted still take priority.
- ArenaTouch hides the RUN button while `AutoRun` is true.

## Mobile mouse-delta guard (ShoulderCam 1.2)

On touch devices `UserInputService:GetMouseDelta()` also reports touch drags while MouseBehavior is LockCenter, so in 1.1
the movement thumbstick (and any touch) turned the camera through the mouse-aim path. 1.2 applies the mouse delta only
when no touch is down and a MouseMovement InputChanged arrived since the last frame. Touch look (right 60% drag,
`ShoulderCamTouchSensitivity`) is unchanged; it is now the only path that turns the camera from a touch.

| Attribute (character) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| ShoulderCamMouseTouchGuard | true | false = 1.1 behaviour (mouse delta always applied) |

Diagnostic, owner client: `ShoulderCamMouseGate` — "applied" (mouse delta used), "touch" (a touch is down, delta
ignored), "idle" (no mouse movement this frame), "off" (guard off), "free" (Left Alt / menu). `ShoulderCamVersion` "1.2".

## Vertical camera lock on phones / tablets (ShoulderCam 1.3)

On a touch device without a mouse (`UserInputService.TouchEnabled and not MouseEnabled`) the camera pitch is set every
frame to `ShoulderCamTouchPitch`, after all look input. Touch drags, the thumbstick and the ShoulderCamLookAt hook cannot
tilt it up or down there. Left / right turning (yaw) is unchanged. PC and touch laptops keep free pitch.

| Attribute (character) | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| ShoulderCamTouchPitchLock | false (1.5; 1.3–1.4: true) | true = lock the pitch on touch devices at ShoulderCamTouchPitch |
| ShoulderCamTouchPitch | -30 (1.4; 1.3: -20) | Locked pitch (degrees; more negative = camera higher, looking down more) |
| ShoulderCamTouchPitchLockTest | nil | Test hook: true treats this device as touch-only (Studio's emulator keeps MouseEnabled true) |

Diagnostic, owner client: `ShoulderCamPitchLock` — "locked" (touch device, pitch fixed), "free" (mouse device), "off"
(lock off). `ShoulderCamVersion` "1.3".

## One attack button per dino (ArenaRules 1.2 / ArenaTouch 1.2)

Kepu 2026-10-28: "each dino will have one attack button, the rest will be mecha add ons". The raptor's attack is POUNCE;
its bite is off.

| Attribute | Where | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| ArenaRaptorNoBite | ArenaRules (script) | true | Sets BiteEnabled = false on player characters with Species "Raptor"; false gives the bite back |
| ArenaBiteRule | character (diagnostic) | — | "raptorNoBite" / "raptorBite" (rule off) / "notRaptor" |
| ArenaTouchMainButton | character (diagnostic, client) | — | "Bite" / "Pounce" / "none": which move is the big yellow button |

ArenaTouch 1.2 hides BITE while BiteEnabled is false and draws POUNCE big and yellow in BITE's place (PounceMain, dimmed
while PounceTestState is not "ready").

## Skill tree data (SkillTree 1.0)

Pure module, no attributes. `ServerStorage.DinoArcade.SkillTree`; SkillServer 1.0 copies it to
`ReplicatedStorage.SkillShared` for the client. Effects (`SkillTree.effects`) → what SkillEffects 1.0 writes:
attackPts / defensePts / speedPts → player `StatAdded_Attack` / `_Defense` / `_Speed`; regenDelay / regenRate;
killRegenAdd → `KillRegenFraction`; lifesteal; shieldMax / shieldTime → `SkillShield`; mainCdMul → `BiteCooldown` or
`PounceCooldown`; moveCdMul → `PounceCooldown` / `RamCooldown` / `JumpCooldown`; bleedDps / bleedTime; crushStun /
crushCooldown → bot `StunnedUntil`; tossMul → `StunTossDistance`; stunMul / stunImmuneAbove → `StunnedUntil`.

## Skill points and saving (SkillServer 1.0)

| Attribute | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SkillEnabled | script | true; false = no XP, requests answered "disabled" |
| SkillKillXpFraction | script | 0.5: kill XP = bot DummyMaxHealth × this (raptor bot 30, T-Rex bot 100) |
| SkillSaveEnabled | script | true; false = session only (SkillSaveState "off") |
| SkillServerVersion, SkillKillsCounted | script | diagnostics |
| SkillLevel, SkillXP, SkillXPInto, SkillXPNext | player | level and XP (SkillXPNext 0 at level 61) |
| SkillPoints, SkillSpent, SkillLeft | player | points earned (level − 1, cap 60), spent, left |
| SkillPath_&lt;pathId&gt; | player | steps bought on that path, 0–4 (all 15 paths) |
| SkillLastResult | player | "ok" / "noPoints" / "soon" / "maxed" / "unknownPath" / "badArg" / "busy" / "disabled" |
| SkillLastXp | player | "kill +30" |
| SkillSaveState | player | "loading" / "loaded" / "new" / "saved" / "failed" / "noApi" / "off" |
| SkillLevelUpAt | player | server time of the last level-up from XP |
| SkillXpCredited | bot | the credited player's name, or "noPlayer" |

Remote: `ReplicatedStorage.SkillRequest` (RemoteEvent) — `("buy", pathId)` or `("respec")`. DataStore `MDA_Skills_v1`,
key `"u" .. UserId`, value `{v = 1, xp, steps}`; saved on change (≤ every 10 s, failed retried every 30 s), on leave
and on server close.

## Skill effects (SkillEffects 1.0)

| Attribute | Where | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SkillEffectsEnabled | script | true; false = every effect off, bases written back |
| SkillEffectsVersion | script | diagnostic |
| StatAdded_Attack / _Defense / _Speed | player (written) | stat points from the paths; StatServer applies them |
| SkillBase_BiteCooldown / _PounceCooldown / _RamCooldown / _JumpCooldown / _KillRegenFraction | character | values captured at spawn |
| BiteCooldown, PounceCooldown, RamCooldown, JumpCooldown, KillRegenFraction | character (written) | base × skill multiplier |
| SkillEffectsState | character | "ready" / "off" |
| SkillRegenActive | character | true while regenerating |
| SkillLastHeal | character | "regen +2" / "lifesteal +4" |
| SkillShield, SkillShieldUntil | character | overheal shield HP and its end time (server time) |
| SkillStunTrimmed | character | "immune" / "trimmed" / "tossTrimmed" |
| SkillBleedUntil, SkillBleedBy, SkillCrushedAt | bot | bleed end time, who made it bleed, last crushing hit |

A bleed kill stamps the bot like BiteServer: `KilledBy`, `KilledByUserId`, `KilledWith` = "bleed", then `KilledAt`.

## Skill tree screen (SkillScreen 1.0)

Client only. Reads the player's Skill* attributes (SkillServer 1.0) and `ReplicatedStorage.SkillShared.SkillTree`; sends
`ReplicatedStorage.SkillRequest` ("buy", pathId) / ("respec"). ScreenGuis: `SkillButton` (DisplayOrder 6),
`SkillScreenDim` (20), `SkillScreen` (21). Named parts: `SkillButton.Skills`, `SkillScreen.Root.Top.Close / Respec`,
`Root.Body.Rail.Area_<id>`, `Root.Body.Cols.Col_<pathId>.Stack.Node_<n>`, `Root.Body.Detail.Buy`, `Root.Confirm.Yes / No`.

| Attribute (character, this client) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| SkillScreenVersion | "1.0" |
| SkillScreenOpen | true / false ("noServer" when SkillServer's remote never appeared) |
| SkillScreenArea | the open area id |
| SkillScreenLastPress | "open" / "close" / "area:&lt;id&gt;" / "node:&lt;pathId&gt;:&lt;n&gt;" / "buy:&lt;pathId&gt;" / "respec" / "respecYes" / "respecNo" |

## Shield in the health bar (ArenaStatus 1.1)

| Attribute (character) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ArenaStatusShieldEnabled | true | false = no shield section (1.0 look) |
| ArenaStatusShield | — | diagnostic, this client: "shown" / "hidden" |

Reads `SkillShield` (SkillEffects 1.0). The blue section is `SkillShield / MaxHealth` of the bar wide, drawn after the green
fill and moved left just enough to stay inside the bar.

## Territories (Territory 1.0 / BotRoam 1.1)

Pure modules, no attributes. `Territory.inside(species, x, z)`: TRex x <= -40; Raptor x >= 40 and z <= 560; both at least
300 studs from the spawn (88, 904); other species anywhere. `Territory.home` mirrors a marker across x = 0 when it is in
the wrong half. BotRoam 1.1 takes `opts.inside` so roaming spots and paths stay in the zone.

## Bot territories (BotServer 1.12)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| BotTerritoryEnabled | script BotServer | true | false = v1.11 (bots go anywhere) |
| BotTerritoryState | script BotServer | — | diagnostic: "on" / "off" |
| BotBorderDrops | script BotServer and bot | 0 | chases dropped because the player left the bot's zone |
| BotTerritory | bot | — | diagnostic: "TRex" / "Raptor" (zone used), "none" while off |
| BotState "border" | bot | — | the bot just dropped a chase at its border |

`ROAM_BORDER_MARGIN` (15, code constant): roam spots and paths stay at least 15 studs inside the zone edge.
`BotFightEnabled` is false in Mecha (place attribute + BotServer.meta.json).

## Raptor pack section (Territory 1.1 / BotServer 1.13)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| BotPackSectionEnabled | script BotServer | true | false = v1.12 (one raptor zone for packs and lone raptors) |
| BotSoloExtra | script BotServer | 5 | extra lone roam raptors (groups Solo1..SoloN), read at server start |
| BotPackSectionState | script BotServer | — | diagnostic: "on" / "off" |
| BotTerritory | bot | — | now "RaptorPack" (pack of more than 1) / "RaptorSolo" (lone) / "TRex" |

Bands (Territory 1.1, split `PACK_SPLIT_Z` -190): RaptorSolo z > -190 (nearer the spawn), RaptorPack z <= -190 (far half).
A chase stops at the band line exactly like at the territory border (BotBorderDrops, BotState "border").

## Mecha parts: loadout + Thrusters (SkillTree 1.1 / SkillServer 1.1 / SkillEffects 1.1 / MechaServer 1.0 / MechaButtons 1.0 / SkillScreen 1.1)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| SkillSlot1 / SkillSlot2 | player | "" | loadout slot: path id ("thrusters") or "" (SkillServer 1.1, saved) |
| SkillLoadoutEnabled | script SkillServer | true | false = slot requests "disabled", buys don't auto-slot |
| DashEnabled | character | false | Thrusters bought AND in a slot AND SkillEffects on |
| DashCharges | character | 0 | 1 at I, 2 from II (0 while off) |
| DashDistance | character | 0 | 35 studs, 50 from III |
| DashHop | character | 0 | 25 studs at star (0 while off) |
| DashTime / DashRecharge | character | 1 (1.35 from III) / 8 | from script SkillEffects SkillDashTime / SkillDashRecharge |
| DashChargesLeft / DashNextChargeAt | character | 0 / 0 | MechaServer: charges left; server time the next one comes back (0 = full) |
| DashStartedAt / DashCount | character | — | MechaServer: accepted dash (server time, clamped stamp) / count |
| DashServerResult / DashDenyReason / DashDeniedAt / DashDenyCount | character | — | "ok" / "badArg" / "dead" / "disabled" / "stunned" / "latched" / "charges" |
| MechaThrustersLook | character | "none" | "none" / "I" / "III" / "star" / "noTorso" |
| MechaEnabled | script MechaServer | true | false = every dash "disabled", parts removed |

| SkillScreenLoadoutEnabled | script SkillScreen | true | false = no loadout bar |

| DashSpeedMul | character | 1.75 | v1.2: boost speed = this x run speed (script SkillEffects SkillDashSpeedMul; 2 in 1.2, 3 in 1.3, 1.75 from 1.4) |
| MechaFlame | character | false | MechaServer 1.1: true while the thruster fire is on |
| MechaBoostDir | character (client) | — | MechaButtons 1.1: "move" (steering with movement) / "keep" (last direction) |
| MechaNewsShown | character (client) | — | MechaButtons 1.1: path id of the last "NEW" popup |

| MechaBoostSoundId | script MechaServer | rbxassetid://9114554567 | v1.2: boost roar sound (placeholder) |
| MechaBoostFxEnabled | script MechaButtons | true | v1.2: false = no camera punch / speed lines |
| MechaBoostFx | character (client) | 0 | v1.2: boost effect strength k (0.1 steps) |
| STRONG | SkillTree constant | true | v1.3: the 35% rule numbers (false = 1.2 numbers) |
| MAX_ADDED_BY | StatSheet constant | {Speed = 16} | v1.1: per-stat added-point cap (others 10) |

v1.1 changes (Kepu after trying it on PC): Thrusters is a steerable boost (DashTime 1.5 s, 2 s from III, at 2x run speed);
PC keys are R (slot 1) and C (slot 2); a "⚙ NEW: <PART>" popup shows how to use a newly bought part; the fire is visible
(fire particles, neon jets, glow) for the whole boost. DashDistance is no longer used by the boost.

Remote `ReplicatedStorage.DinoDashRequest:FireServer(serverTime)`; SkillRequest ("slot", n, id or ""). The dash costs no
stamina (Kepu). The Thrusters part is on the dino only while it is in a slot (Kepu).

## Game speed (ArenaRules 1.3 / StatServer 1.1 / BotServer 1.14)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| ArenaSpeedScale | script ArenaRules | 0.65 | every dino's walk / run / creep speed x this (players and bots; 1 = as before; live) |

| CloakStill | character | star: standing still keeps the cloak (up to 2 x CloakTime) |

SkillTree module flags: BUILD_LIMITS (true: 40 points, level cap 41, MASTERY_MAX 3), SLOTS 4. Path ownership and the
per-dino lists: docs/plans/CLOAK_v1.0.md.

## Cloak Field (CloakServer 1.0 / PounceServer 1.5 / BotServer 1.15)

Button look: the tap part big; the pull part "▼ NAME" along the bottom (rgb(255, 217, 168), 0.5 while not ready); white
4 px stroke while pulling. The Cloak button reads "CLOAK" with the cooldown fill from CloakReadyAt / CloakCooldown.

## Skill tree screen: tier rows + Mastery (SkillScreen 1.3)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| SkillScreenTierRowsEnabled | script SkillScreen | true | classic tier-row tree; false = the 1.2 area rail + columns (both per dino via pathsFor) |
| SkillScreenLayout | character (owner client) | — | "tiers" / "rail" |
| SkillScreenTreeLines | character (owner client) | — | path ids in tree order (Raptor: regen ... decoy, 14; T-Rex: lifesteal ... roaramp, 12) |
| SkillScreenTreeScale | character (owner client) | — | tree scale s (0.01; at least 0.75 = node radius 9) |
| SkillScreenTreeScroll | character (owner client) | — | "none" / "x" / "y" / "xy" (the tree pane scrolls when the canvas is bigger) |
| SkillScreenMastery | character (owner client) | — | "n/3": mastered lines (step >= 3) of this dino |

Node states: own (filled, area colour) / next (white outline) / lock (dark) / soon (dashed, 0.6) / mlock (step III or
star of an unmastered line while 3 lines are mastered: 0.4 with a lock; BUY "MASTERY FULL · RESPEC TO CHANGE" and the
gold reason in the detail panel). Mastered lines: gold rings + gold halo under the lit links. Instances:
SkillScreen.Root.Body.Cols.Tree.Canvas.Col_<pathId>.Node_<1-4>; Root.Top.Mastery; Root.Body.Detail.Why;
Root.Body.Loadout.Slot_1..4.

## Test unlock (SkillServer 1.4)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| SkillTestCloakEnabled | script SkillServer | false (code) / **true in the place** (testing, 2026-10-29) | raptor shows Cloak Field at star in slot 1 (R); display layer only, never saved; points not charged |
| SkillTestCloak | player | — | "on" while the layer is shown (Raptor + switch on), else "off" |

Turn SkillTestCloakEnabled off on ServerScriptService.SkillServer before a public publish.
SkillServer 1.5: the layer counts the Cloak as owned for the loadout and places it once in the first empty slot; nothing is hidden, so bought parts and the SKILLS tiles work as normal.

## Always-run gait + raptor speed (IdleAnimation 1.26 / RaptorModelData 1.13)

| Attribute | On | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| GaitAlwaysRun | dino model (Raptor data, T-Rex StarterCharacter) | true | IdleAnimation shows the run gait at every moving speed (no walk animation); false / missing = 1.25 walk-to-run blend |
| MoveWalkSpeed / MoveRunSpeed | raptor (data) | 41.6 / 78 | 1.3 x the T-Rex's 32 / 60; in play x ArenaSpeedScale 0.65 = 27 / 50.7 (T-Rex 20.8 / 39). Raptor bots use the same values |

## Cloak look: camo plates + turn-on animation (CloakServer 1.1 / CloakFX 1.1)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| CloakLookStyle | script CloakServer | "plates" | "plates" = 4 black hex plates with cyan rims on the spine; "fins" = the 1.0 grey fins |
| CloakLookStyle (1.2) | script CloakServer | "flanks" | 1.2 default: 4 plates flat on each flank (upper half), Plate_1..4 right / 5..8 left; CloakLook "flanks" |
| PlateOrder | Weld PlateHinge | 1..4 | 1.2: the plate's row front to back; CloakFX 1.3 flip timing |
| CloakLook | character | — | now also "plates" ("on" = fins) |
| BaseC0 | Weld PlateHinge (Plate_n_Body_0) | — | the plate's resting C0; CloakFX turns the plate from it |
| CloakFXAnimEnabled | script CloakFX | true | false = the 1.0 instant cloak look (no flip, no dissolve) |
| CloakFXPhase | each dino (this client) | — | "turningOn" (0.56 s) / "on" / "turningOff" (0.35 s) / "off" |
| CloakFXShadowOff | script CloakFX | true | 1.2: cloaked parts cast no shadow on this client; false = shadows as 1.1 |

Turn-on: plates flip front to back (0.06 s apart, 0.12 s each) and show teal rgb(18, 58, 68); body blocks flash neon cyan
for 0.08 s and fade in order of distance from the plates (0.12 - 0.56 s). Turn-off reverses it. Hitboxes and invisible
parts never flash.

## Thrusters boost lean + booster swivel (MechaServer 1.3 / IdleAnimation 1.27 / BoostPose 1.0)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| MechaSwivelHinge | script MechaServer | true | true: each booster hangs on a Weld "BoosterHinge" (the group turns with it); false: the 1.2 fixed build |
| MechaHinge | character | — | "hinge" / "fixed": how the current Mecha_Thrusters was built |
| BaseC0 | Weld BoosterHinge | — | the hinge's rest C0 (booster frame in Torso.Root's frame); clients return to it after a boost |
| BoostLeanEnabled / BoostSwivelEnabled | dino model | true / true | false: no body lean / boosters stay fixed |
| BoostLeanForward / BoostLeanBack / BoostLeanSide | dino model | 10 / 15 / 12 | degrees: chest down (forward boost) / chest up (backward) / bank (sideways; right travel = left side down) |
| BoostSwivelOver | dino model | 160 | degrees the boosters swing up and over for a straight-back boost (100..179) |
| BoostEaseIn / BoostEaseOut | dino model | 0.15 / 0.25 | s: blend in from DashStartedAt, out after DashStartedAt + DashTime |
| BoostDirRate / BoostDirMinSpeed | dino model | 12 / 2 | how fast the travel direction follows the movement (per s); studs/s below which it is held |
| BoostSwivelGap | dino model | 1.15 | x booster width: minimum gap between the two booster axes (they slide apart along the back) |
| BoostLeanBlend | dino model (client) | — | boost weight 0..1 (0.1 steps) |
| BoostDir | dino model (client) | — | travel direction in degrees, atan2(right, forward): 0 forward, 90 right, ±180 back |
| BoostLeanPitch / BoostLeanRoll | dino model (client) | — | applied lean in degrees (+ pitch = chest up, + roll = right side down) |
| BoostSwivel | dino model (client) | — | "none" / "on" / "noHinge" (Mecha_Thrusters without hinges) / "off" (BoostSwivelEnabled false) |
| BoostSwivelAngle / BoostStagger | dino model (client) | — | booster turn in degrees; studs the two boosters are slid apart |

## Raptor parts batch 1 (SkillTree 1.6 / SkillEffects 1.6 / PounceServer 1.6 / BladeServer, AdrenalineServer, EnergyShieldServer 1.0)

| Attribute | On | Default / values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| BladeLook | character | false / true | Blade Claws bought (SkillEffects); BladeServer shows the sickles |

| BladeServerEnabled | script BladeServer | true | false: no sickles / flick / slash |
| BladeLookState / BladeFlick | character | "none" / "on" / "noFeet"; "down" / "up" | diagnostics |
| AdrenalineEnabled / Heal / Time / SpeedMul / Cooldown / StunClear | character | false; 0.20 / 0.27; 3; 1.3; 20 / 14.8; star true | Adrenaline settings (only while slotted) |
| AdrenalineStartedAt / Until / ReadyAt | character | — | server state (cooldown from the end) |
| AdrenalineServerResult | character | badArg / dead / disabled / stunned / latched / active / cooldown / ok | last request |
| AdrenalineHealed / AdrenalineEndReason / AdrenalineStunCleared / AdrenalineLook | character | — | diagnostics |
| AdrenalineServerEnabled | script AdrenalineServer | true | off switch |
| EnergyShieldEnabled / Time / Cooldown / SpeedMul | character | false; 1.5 / 2.05 / star 2.77; 16 / 11.8; 0.5 / star 0.68 | Energy Shield settings (only while slotted) |
| EnergyShieldStartedAt / Until / ReadyAt / State | character | — | server state; "on" while blocking |
| EnergyShieldServerResult / Blocks / BlockAt / EndReason / Look | character | — | diagnostics (blocks = LastHitAt stamps while up) |
| EnergyShieldServerEnabled | script EnergyShieldServer | true | off switch |
| MoveSpeedParts | character (client) | "none" / "adrenaline" / "shield" / "adrenaline+shield" | SprintTest 1.6: which part multipliers apply |

Jaws is not for raptors (SkillTree 1.6 notFor Raptor; refunded on load).
BladeServer 1.1: script BladeSizeMul (3; hook size multiplier), BladeOuterSide (true; false = the inner side as 1.0).
SkillServer 1.6: SkillTestCloakEnabled now gives every live mecha part of the active dino at star; player SkillTestParts lists them.

### Looks upgrade (SkillTree 1.7 / AdrenalineServer 1.1 / EnergyShieldServer 1.1 / BladeServer 1.2)

| Attribute | On | Default / values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| AdrenalineHeal / AdrenalineSpeedMul | character | 0.25 / 0.34 from II; 1.4 | SkillTree 1.7 numbers (were 0.20 / 0.27; 1.3) |
| AdrenalineLookStyle | script AdrenalineServer | "tanks" / "neck" | look style; "neck" = the 1.0 canister |
| AdrenalineLook | character | "none" / "tanks" / "on" (neck) / "noTorso" / "noNeck" | diagnostics |
| AdrenalineLookStep / AdrenalineTanks | character | 0-4; 1 / 1 / 2 / 3 | step the tanks were built from; tank count |
| AdrenalineGlow | Highlight under the character | — | whole boost, destroyed at the end |
| AdrenalineHealPop | BillboardGui under the HumanoidRootPart | "+N" | every 0.5 s while healing, gone after 0.85 s |
| EnergyShieldLookStyle | script EnergyShieldServer | "dome" / "shell" | look style; "shell" = the 1.0 Highlight + chest emitter |
| EnergyShieldLook | character | "none" / "dome" / "on" (shell) / "noTorso" | diagnostics |
| EnergyShieldLookStep | character | 1-4 | step the shoulder emitters were built from |
| EnergyShieldRipples | character | count | blocks that drew a ripple on the dome |
| EnergyShieldDome / EnergyShieldDome2 / EnergyShieldDomeTint / EnergyShieldRipple | workspace parts | — | the dome while up (outside the character: its size stays the same) |
| BladeArmBladesEnabled | script BladeServer | true | false: no forearm blades |
| EnergyShieldLookStyle (1.2) | script EnergyShieldServer | "shell" / "dome" | 1.2 default back to the 1.0 shell |
| EnergyShieldEmitterStyle | script EnergyShieldServer | "shoulders" / "chest" | emitter look (1.2) |
| EnergyShieldShellRefreshes | character | count | shell rebuilt to stay the newest Highlight while up (1.2) |
| AdrenalineTankState | character | "full" / "draining" / "refilling" | tank fluid (AdrenalineServer 1.2; star ring removed) |
| AdrenalineTankFullAt | character | server time / 0 | when the tanks will be full again |
| DashTime / DashSpeedMul (thrusters) | character | 1.37 / 1.85 s from III; 2 | SkillTree 1.8 / SkillEffects 1.7 (were 1.0 / 1.35; 1.75) |
| MechaAirUpEnabled / MechaAirUpHeight / MechaAirUpTime | script MechaButtons | true; 30; 0.6 | straight-up boost in the air with no move input (1.6) |
| MechaBoostMode / MechaAirUpCount | character (client) | "ground" / "air" / "up"; count | which boost the last press gave |
| MechaAirUpPhase | character (client) | "rise" / "hover" / "done" | straight-up boost: rising, holding the height until DashTime ends, ended |
| BladeLookStep / BladeArmBlades / BladeTrails | character | 0-4; 0 / 2; "off" / "on" | diagnostics (trails only at star) |

## Skills per dino (SkillServer 1.2 / SkillScreen 1.2)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| SkillPerDinoEnabled | script SkillServer | true | each dino (character Species) has its own XP, level, steps and loadout; false = one shared record "All" |
| SkillDino | player | — | diagnostic: the dino whose record the Skill* player attributes show now |
| SkillScreenDinoTitleEnabled | script SkillScreen | true | the SKILLS screen title shows the dino name (T-REX / RAPTOR); false = "SKILLS" |
| SkillScreenTitle | character (owner client) | — | diagnostic: the title text shown |

Save: DataStore "MDA_Skills_v2", key "u" .. UserId, value {v = 2, dinos = {[dino] = {xp, steps, loadout}}}. The 1.1 store
"MDA_Skills_v1" (one shared build) is no longer used and is kept as it was (Kepu: reset all).

## Ability bar (AbilityBar 1.0, PC)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| AbilityBarEnabled | script AbilityBar | true | false = no bar (AbilityBarState "off") |
| AbilityBarVersion | character (owner client) | — | "1.0" |
| AbilityBarState | character (owner client) | — | "on" / "touch" (touch device, no bar) / "off" / "skills" (1.1: hidden while the SKILLS screen is open) |
| AbilityBarHideOnSkills | script AbilityBar | true | 1.1: hide the bar while SkillScreenOpen is true |
| AbilityBarTiles | character (owner client) | — | key:name list, e.g. "R:DASH,C:+,F:POUNCE,Space:LEAP" |
| AbilityBar_<Tile> | character (owner client) | — | Slot_1 / Slot_2 / Pounce / Leap / Bite / Ram: "empty" / "off" / "active" / "cooling" / "ready" / "stunned"; Ram without a tile "hidden" |

Reads only: SkillSlot1 / SkillSlot2 (player), DashEnabled, DashCharges, DashChargesLeft, DashNextChargeAt, DashRecharge,
MechaDashLocal, BitePredictedAt / PouncePredictedAt / JumpPredictedAt / RamPredictedAt + BiteCooldown / PounceCooldown /
JumpCooldown / RamCooldown, PounceTestState / JumpTestState / RamTestState, StunnedUntil, RamLatchGate, Species, the
moves' Enabled attributes. Layout and the state map: docs/plans/ABILITY_BAR_v1.0.md.

## Air pounce (PounceTest 1.4 / MechaButtons 1.3)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| PounceAirEnabled | character | true | F / X / touch Pounce also works in the air, once per time in the air (any launch uses it; back after landing) |
| PounceLaunchFrom | character (owner client) | — | diagnostic: "ground" / "air" for the last launch |
| PounceInputResult "airUsed" | character (owner client) | — | diagnostic: a second press in the same air time |
| MechaBoostPounceEnds | script MechaButtons | true | a Thrusters boost ends when a pounce starts (wind-up / lunge); false = 1.2 behaviour |
| MechaBoostEnd | character (owner client) | — | diagnostic: "pounce" when a pounce ended the boost |

The lunge is the ground one (PounceUpSpeed up + PounceDistance / flight time forward, 140 studs/s at RaptorScale 2) from
wherever the raptor is; gravity brings it down. Launched far above a target, it carries you past it (Play: from 66 studs
up and 23 studs behind, landed 105 studs beyond).

## Pounce claim scale (PounceServer 1.4)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| PounceScaleClaimEnabled | script PounceServer | true | "far" limit = 24 × the raptor's Model:GetScale() and offset margin = 8 × the same (never below × 1); false = 24 / 8 as in 1.3 |
| PounceServerVersion | script PounceServer | — | "1.4" |
| PounceClaimTolerance | raptor | — | diagnostic: studs the last claim was checked against (48 at RaptorScale 2) |

Cause: RaptorScale 1.0 doubled the raptor and its lunge (140 studs/s) but not the claim limit. Play-measured with a target
running 33.8 studs/s: 1.3 rejected "far" at 24.1 (from behind, Tail5) and 26.8 (head-on, Head) → PounceTest let go
("rejected"); 1.4 accepted 22.7 and 26.6 and held the pin.

## T-Rex step rate (TRexModelData 1.23)

| Attribute (StarterCharacter, T-Rex) | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| WalkStrideStretch | 2 (was default 1) | walk: ground covered per gait cycle x2 = half the steps; planted feet glide 50% of the speed |
| RunStrideStretch | 2 (was default 1) | run: same |
| CreepStrideStretch | default 1 | unchanged |

Step rate = ground speed / stride (distance-driven, WalkPose 3.3). Play-measured at run 39 studs/s: stretch 1 = 17.7 studs per
cycle, 2.17 cycles/s; stretch 2 = 33.5 studs per cycle, 1.17 cycles/s. The T-Rex bot clones StarterCharacter, so it matches.

## Bigger raptors (RaptorScale 1.0)

| Attribute | On | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| RaptorScaleEnabled | script RaptorScale | true | false = new raptors keep scale 1 (already scaled ones stay) |
| RaptorScale | script RaptorScale | 2 | size factor for every raptor (player and bot) |
| RaptorScaleVersion | script RaptorScale | "1.0" | diagnostic |
| RaptorScaleCount | script RaptorScale | 0 | diagnostic: models scaled since start |
| RaptorScaleApplied | raptor model | — | diagnostic: factor applied (set once; blocks a second scale) |
| RaptorScaleLift | raptor model | — | diagnostic: studs lifted to stand on the ground (0.1 steps) |

Multiplied by the factor: the GrowthCurve distance keys the raptor has (BiteReachBack, BiteLungeDist, PounceDistance,
PounceReach, PounceLatchStandoff, EatRange, EatHeight, CameraStartZoom, ShoulderCamDistance; missing keys use GrowthServer's
FALLBACK, keys with neither are left alone). Health, speeds and damage are unchanged.

## Arena scope (ArenaScope 1.3)
- Expects `RaptorScale` on. Script `ArenaScope` `ArenaScope_BotFight` = "off" (BotServer `BotFightEnabled` false) /
  "mismatch" (counted in `ArenaScopeMismatches`).

## Arena scope (ArenaScope 1.6)
- Also expects `CloakServer` (ServerScriptService) and `CloakFX` (StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts) on:
  `ArenaScope_CloakServer`, `ArenaScope_CloakFX` = "on" / "mismatch" / "missing".

## Growth (GrowthCurve 1.0 — maths only; GrowthServer applies it)
Plan: docs/plans/GROWTH_v1.0.md (ADR-001). GrowthCurve has no attributes of its own; these are the character attributes it
scales from the adult values (GrowthServer stores the adult value as `GrowthBase_<name>` and writes the scaled one):
| Group | Attributes | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| Speed | MoveWalkSpeed, MoveRunSpeed, MoveCreepSpeed | stage 0.80 / 0.87 / 0.93 / 1.00 (0.1 steps) |
| Strength | BiteDamage, PounceLandDamage, PounceTickDamage (and max health) | 0.4 + 0.6 × (level − 1) / 19 (whole numbers) |
| Distance | ~~BiteRange~~ (1.1: not scaled), BiteReachBack, BiteLungeDist, PounceDistance, PounceReach, PounceLatchStandoff, EatRange, EatHeight, CameraStartZoom, ShoulderCamDistance | stage size 0.4 / 0.6 / 0.8 / 1.0 (0.01 steps) |

GrowthCurve 1.1: BiteRange (the hit radius around the snout line, i.e. the bite's forgiveness) keeps the species value at
every stage. Measured: a Hatchling raptor's radius had become 1.2 studs; auto-aim chose the lying T-Rex bot but its Torso
was 3.6 studs from the mouth (beyond 1.2 + BiteAimSlack 2), so both bites missed. With 3 both hit.

## Growth (GrowthServer 1.0, DINO-7)
Plan: docs/plans/GROWTH_v1.0.md (ADR-001). Records live for the server session only (DataStore saving = DINO-10).
| Attribute (GrowthServer script) | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| GrowthEnabled | true | false: every character gets its adult values back (scale 1, attributes, max health), no XP; true again: re-applied |
| XpPerFood | 1 | XP per food point eaten (SurvivalFoodEaten increase) |
| XpPerWater | 0.5 | XP per water point drunk (SurvivalWaterDrunk increase) |
| XpPerDamage | 1 | XP per damage point (BiteHitDamage / PounceHitDamage) × size ratio |
| KillXpFraction | 0.5 | Kill XP = target max health (DummyMaxHealth, else Humanoid.MaxHealth) × this × size ratio |

Size ratio = target body length / own body length, clamped 1–10 (GrowthBodyLength, else the largest extent). A T-Rex bot
(40.13) bitten by a Hatchling raptor (5.09) = ×7.88.
Character attributes: `GrowthLevel`, `GrowthStage` (1–4), `GrowthStageName`, `GrowthXP`, `GrowthXPNext`, `GrowthSkillPoints`
(level − 1, banked for the skill tree), `GrowthScale`, `GrowthLevelUpAt`, `GrowthStageUpAt`, `GrowthBodyLength`,
`GrowthState` (waiting / ready / disabled), `GrowthLastXp` ("eat +n" / "drink" / "bite" / "pounce" / "kill"), `GrowthXpTotal`,
`GrowthApplied`, `GrowthBase_<key>`, `GrowthBaseMaxHealth`, `GrowthBaseLength`. Player: `GrowthSaveState` ("session"),
`GrowthDeathDrop` ("Lv a -> Lv b"), `GrowthDeathDropAt`. Script: `GrowthServerVersion`, `GrowthKillsCounted`.
Verified in Play:
- T-Rex spawn: Lv1 Hatchling, scale 0.4, 80 / 80 HP, bite 10, run 48 (place run 60 × 0.8), zoom 14, eat range 3.2, length 16.05.
- +60 food → Lv4 (0 / 30); +70 water XP → Lv6 Juvenile, scale 0.6, run 52.2, bite 14, 112 HP; client re-fit correct.
- T-Rex: 3 real bites + a kill on a stunned raptor bot → +79 XP (damage 49 + kill 30), GrowthKillsCounted 1.
- Switch to Raptor: own record, Lv1, scale 0.4, 24 HP, length 5.09. 2 real bites on the lying T-Rex bot, 3 damage each →
  +47.3 XP (6 × 7.88) → Lv3 (12.3 / 25).
- Death at Lv7 Juvenile (7.3 XP) → respawn Lv2 Hatchling, 7.3 XP kept, scale 0.6 → 0.4, species kept.
- Raptor at 0.4 walks 25 studs/s (WalkSpeed 24), lowest foot 0.00–0.07 studs above the ground under it.
- GrowthEnabled false → scale 1, 60 / 60 HP, run 52, bite 8, eat range 8, zoom 16, GrowthState disabled; 10 food + 10 water
  while off = no XP, and none credited after true again; +4 food after that → +4 XP.

## Growth bar (GrowthBar 1.0, DINO-8)
No settings. Position `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 1, -198)` instead of the plan's −176: SurvivalBars draws its "[E] Hold to eat /
drink" hint 22 px above its holder (−192 … −174), so −176 would cover it. Diagnostics (owner client): character
`GrowthBarState` (shown / hidden), `GrowthBarMessage` ("title | line"), `GrowthBarMessageAt`, `GrowthBarCompact`,
`GrowthBarVersion`; player `GrowthBarDropShownAt`.
Verified in Play (1676 × 736 viewport): bar 436–480 px, hint row 486–504, SurvivalBars 508–552 (6 px clear); +16 food →
"Level 2 | +1 skill point"; +109 → "You grew into a juvenile! | Bigger body · 112 max health · bite 14" (stage message
replaces the level one); death at Lv6 → "Dropped to Lv 1 · hatchling | Lv 6 -> Lv 1"; holder forced to 260 px at
"LV 15 · SUB-ADULT" / "249 / 250 XP" / "14 skill pts" → compact, 8 px between title and value, chip inside the holder;
Lv20 → "MAX", full bar; GrowthEnabled false → hidden, true → shown again.

## Re-fit on scale (IdleAnimation 1.24 / ShoulderCam 1.1 / CameraZoom 1.1, DINO-6)
Why: `Model:ScaleTo` on the server shrinks parts, but the client animator kept full-size joint rest frames, so a scaled dino
came apart (0.5 scale: client Neck C0 6.3 vs server 3.15, extents 32 instead of 20). Now each client re-fits when
`Model:GetScale()` changes. No settings. Diagnostics: `IdleRefitCount`, `IdleRefitScale`, `IdleAnimationVersion` (every client,
model attributes); `ShoulderCamScale`, `ShoulderCamVersion`, `CameraZoomApplied`, `CameraZoomVersion` (owner client).
Verified in Play (server ScaleTo 0.5 → 0.4 → 0.6 → 0.8 → 1.0 → 0.4): client Neck C0 equals the server's at 0.4 (2.52, 1.04),
extents 16.1 studs long (0.4 × 40.1), feet stay on the ground while walking at 0.4 (lowest foot −0.08 … 0.00 studs).

## Turning (TurnPose)
| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| TurnHeadEnabled | true | Head leans into turns while moving |
| TurnHeadMax | 20 | Most head yaw into a turn (°) |
| TurnHeadGain | 0.06 | Head yaw (°) per °/s of turning |
| TurnHeadRoll | 0.4 | Head tilt into the turn, as a share of the yaw |
| TurnHeadSmooth | 8 | How fast the turn rate is followed (per second) |

Diagnostics: `TurnRate` (°/s, positive = left), `TurnHead` (°).

## Heavy turning (TurnLimit 1.0) and head lead (HeadLeadPose 1.0)
The body turns toward the move input at most `TurnLimitRate` °/s (Humanoid.AutoRotate is off while this runs) and
moves where the body faces, so sharp turns swing wide (radius = speed / turn rate: walk 20 ≈ 6.4 studs, run 44 ≈ 14 studs).
The neck and head turn toward the input direction first (the turn still to go, clamped), moving or standing;
the lead fades out during the roar and the bite.

| Attribute | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| TurnLimitEnabled | true | false = Roblox's own turning (AutoRotate) again |
| TurnLimitRate | 180 | Most body turn (°/s); 180 = a 90° turn in 0.5 s |
| HeadLeadEnabled | true | Head turns into the turn before the body |
| HeadLeadMax | 45 | Most neck + head lead (°) |
| HeadLeadSmooth | 10 | How fast the head follows (per second) |
| HeadLeadNeckShare | 0.45 | Share of the lead on the neck (rest on the head) |

Diagnostics, owner client: `TurnLimitState` (disabled/noControls/dead/holding/turning/aligned), `TurnInputSource`
(inputAction/controlModule/none), `TurnBodyYaw`, `TurnTargetYaw`, `TurnErrorLocal` (° still to turn, positive = left),
`TurnErrorSent`, `TurnRemote` (ok/missing). Server (replicated): `TurnError`, `TurnErrorLastResult`
(ok/badArg/rateLimited/dead). Every client: `HeadLead` (°), `HeadLeadSource` (local/server/none),
`HeadLeadState` (off/none/leading/suppressed).

## Hitboxes (DinoHitboxes) and bitable dinos
Every dino gets a `Hitboxes` folder: one box per body part, welded to the part so it follows the animation.
Red (blocks, CanCollide): Torso, Neck, Head, Tail1-5. Blue (bite-only): Jaw, legs, feet, arms. Head and Jaw
